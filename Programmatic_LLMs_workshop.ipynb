        "Recall that when we call an API we are basically making a request to a service, like the way we make a request to a waiter in a restaurant. And just like at a restaurant, where our waiter might expect a certain structure to how we communicate with them (e.g., specifying a main dish we want), APIs in general are exactly the same. They take certain _arguments_, which vary depending on the service, and which inform the service of how exactly to respond (e.g., which model to use). The arguments we can look at today are:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Model**: a string which specifies which of the models available should be used to answer the query (e.g., 4o-mini, o3, etc).\n",
        "*   **Messages**: a dictionary (i.e., with key-value pairs) which specifies the role that a message is being given as (i.e., as a system prompt vs. a user prompt) and the content of that message (e.g., what the user prompt actually says).\n",
        "* **Temperature**: a number which specifies the \"randomness\" in sampling over the tokens; a higher temperature means that less probable tokens will be selected more frequently.\n",
        "* **top_p**: a number which specifies the minimum probability that should be considered for sampling. If top_p = .1, for example, then only those tokens with a greater than 10% probability will be sampled.\n",
        "* **top_k**: a number which specifies how many of the most probable tokens should be sampled over. If top_k = 5, for example, then only the 5 most probable tokens will be considered during sampling. **Note:** Sadly, OpenAI does not expose the top_k parameter, so we can't change it. :-(\n",

We conducted a large-scale, collaborative effort to obtain an initial estimate of the reproducibility of psychological science.</p><p>RESULTS <ref type=\"bibr\">:</ref> We conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using highpowered designs and original materials when available. There is no single standard for evaluating replication success. Here, we evaluated reproducibility using significance and P values, effect sizes, subjective assessments of replication teams, and meta-analysis of effect sizes. The mean effect size (r) of the replication effects (M r = 0.197, SD = 0.257) was half the magnitude of the mean effect size of the original effects (M r = 0.403, SD = 0.188), representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had significant results (P &lt; .05). Thirty-six percent of replications had significant results; 47% of original effect sizes were in the 95% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams.</p><p>CONCLUSION: No single indicator sufficiently describes replication success, and the five indicators examined here are not the only ways to evaluate reproducibility. Nonetheless, collectively these results offer a clear conclusion: A large portion of replications produced weaker evidence for the original findings despite using materials provided by the original authors, review in advance for methodological fidelity, and high statistical power to detect the original effect sizes. Moreover, correlational evidence is consistent with the conclusion that variation in the strength of initial evidence (such as original P value) was more predictive of replication success than variation in the characteristics of the teams conducting the research (such as experience and expertise). The latter factors certainly can influence replication success, but they did not appear to do so here.</p><p>Reproducibility is not well understood because the incentives for individual scientists prioritize novelty over replication. Innovation is the engine of discovery and is vital for a productive, effective scientific enterprise. However, innovative ideas become old news fast. Journal reviewers and editors may dismiss a new test of a published idea as unoriginal. The claim that \"we already know this\" belies the uncertainty of scientific evidence. Innovation points out paths that are possible; replication points out paths that are likely; progress relies on both. Replication can increase certainty when findings are reproduced and promote innovation when they are not.

We conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. Replication effects were half the magnitude of original effects, representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had statistically significant results. Thirty-six percent of replications had statistically significant results; 47% of original effect sizes were in the 95% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams.</p></div>\n",

Scientific claims should not gain credence because of the status or authority of their originator but by the replicability of their supporting evidence. Scientists attempt to transparently describe the methodology and resulting evidence used to support their claims. Other scientists agree or disagree whether the evidence supports the claims, citing theoretical or methodological reasons or by collecting new evidence. Such debates are meaningless, however, if the evidence being debated is not reproducible.</p><p>Even research of exemplary quality may have irreproducible empirical findings because of random or systematic error. Direct replication is the attempt to recreate the conditions believed sufficient for obtaining a previously observed finding <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b6\">(7,</ref><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b7\">8)</ref> and is the means of establishing reproducibility of a finding with new data. A direct replication may not obtain the original result for a variety of reasons: Known or unknown differences between the replication and original study may moderate the size of an observed effect, the original result could have been a false positive, or the replication could produce a false negative. False positives and false negatives provide misleading information about effects, and failure to identify the necessary and sufficient conditions to reproduce a finding indicates an incomplete theoretical understanding. Direct replication provides the opportunity to assess and improve reproducibility.</p><p>There is plenty of concern (9-13) about the rate and predictors of reproducibility but limited evidence. In a theoretical analysis, Ioannidis estimated that publishing and analytic practices make it likely that more than half of research results are false and therefore irreproducible <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b8\">(9)</ref>. Some empirical evidence supports this analysis. In cell biology, two industrial laboratories reported success replicating the original results of landmark findings in only 11 and 25% of the attempted cases, respectively <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b9\">(10,</ref><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b10\">11)</ref>. These numbers are stunning but also difficult to interpret because no details are available about the studies, methodology, or results. With no transparency, the reasons for low reproducibility cannot be evaluated.</p><p>Other investigations point to practices and incentives that may inflate the likelihood of obtaining false-positive results in particular or irreproducible results more generally. Potentially problematic practices include selective reporting, selective analysis, and insufficient specification of the conditions necessary or sufficient to obtain the results <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b11\">(12)</ref><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b12\">(13)</ref><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b13\">(14)</ref><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b14\">(15)</ref><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b15\">(16)</ref><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b16\">(17)</ref><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b17\">(18)</ref><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b18\">(19)</ref><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b19\">(20)</ref><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b20\">(21)</ref><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b21\">(22)</ref><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b22\">(23)</ref>. We were inspired to address the gap in direct empirical evidence about reproducibility. In this Research Article, we report a large-scale, collaborative effort to obtain an initial estimate of the reproducibility of psychological science.</p></div>\n",
            "<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>Method</head><p>Starting in November 2011, we constructed a protocol for selecting and conducting highquality replications <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b23\">(24)</ref>. Collaborators joined the project, selected a study for replication from the available studies in the sampling frame, and were guided through the replication protocol. The replication protocol articulated the process of selecting the study and key effect from the available articles, contacting the original authors for study materials, preparing a study protocol and analysis plan, obtaining review of the protocol by the original authors and other members within the present project, registering the protocol publicly, conducting the replication, writing the final report, and auditing the process and analysis for quality control. Project coordinators facilitated each step of the process and maintained the protocol and project resources. Replication materials and data were required to be archived publicly in order to maximize transparency, accountability, and reproducibility of the project (<ref type=\"url\" target=\"https://osf.io/ezcuj\">https://osf.io/ezcuj</ref>).</p><p>In total, 100 replications were completed by 270 contributing authors. There were many different research designs and analysis strategies in the original research. Through consultation with original authors, obtaining original materials, and internal review, replications maintained high fidelity to the original designs. Analyses converted results to a common effect size metric [correlation coefficient (r)] with confidence intervals (CIs). The units of analysis for inferences about reproducibility were the original and replication study effect sizes. The resulting open data set provides an initial estimate of the reproducibility of psychology and correlational data to support development of hypotheses about the causes of reproducibility.</p></div>\n",
            "<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>Sampling frame and study selection</head><p>We constructed a sampling frame and selection process to minimize selection biases and maximize generalizability of the accumulated evidence. Simultaneously, to maintain high quality, within this sampling frame we matched individual replication projects with teams that had relevant interests and expertise. We pursued a quasi-random sample by defining the sampling frame as 2008 articles of three important psychology journals: Psychological Science (PSCI), Journal of Personality and Social Psychology (JPSP), and Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition (JEP: LMC). The first is a premier outlet for all psychological research; the second and third are leading disciplinary-specific journals for social psychology and cognitive psychology, respectively [more information is available in <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b23\">(24)</ref>]. These were selected a priori in order to (i) provide a tractable sampling frame that would not plausibly bias reproducibility estimates, (ii) enable comparisons across journal types and subdisciplines, (iii) fit with the range of expertise available in the initial collaborative team, (iv) be recent enough to obtain original materials, (v) be old enough to obtain meaningful indicators of citation impact, and (vi) represent psychology subdisciplines that have a high frequency of studies that are feasible to conduct at relatively low cost.</p><p>The first replication teams could select from a pool of the first 20 articles from each journal, starting with the first article published in the first 2008 issue. Project coordinators facilitated matching articles with replication teams by interests and expertise until the remaining articles were difficult to match. If there were still interested teams, then another 10 articles from one or more of the three journals were made available from the sampling frame. Further, project coordinators actively recruited teams from the community with relevant experience for particular articles. This approach balanced competing goals: minimizing selection bias by having only a small set of articles available at a time and matching studies with replication teams' interests, resources, and expertise.</p><p>By default, the last experiment reported in each article was the subject of replication. This decision established an objective standard for study selection within an article and was based on the intuition that the first study in a multiplestudy article (the obvious alternative selection strategy) was more frequently a preliminary demonstration. Deviations from selecting the last experiment were made occasionally on the basis of feasibility or recommendations of the original authors. Justifications for deviations were reported in the replication reports, which were made available on the Open Science Framework (OSF) (<ref type=\"url\" target=\"http://osf.io/ezcuj\">http://osf.io/ezcuj</ref>). In total, 84 of the 100 completed replications (84%) were of the last reported study in the article. On average, the to-be-replicated articles contained 2.99 studies (SD = 1.78) with the following distribution: 24 single study, 24 two studies, 18 three studies, 13 four studies, 12 five studies, 9 six or more studies. All following summary statistics refer to the 100 completed replications.</p><p>For the purposes of aggregating results across studies to estimate reproducibility, a key result from the selected experiment was identified as the focus of replication. The key result had to be represented as a single statistical inference test or an effect size. In most cases, that test was a t test, F test, or correlation coefficient. This effect was identified before data collection or analysis and was presented to the original authors as part of the design protocol for critique. Original authors occasionally suggested that a different effect be used, and by default, replication teams deferred to original authors' judgments. Nonetheless, because the single effect came from a single study, it is not necessarily the case that the identified effect was central to the overall aims of the article. In the individual replication reports and subjective assessments of replication outcomes, more than a single result could be examined, but only the result of the single effect was considered in the aggregate analyses [additional details of the general protocol and individual study methods are provided in the supplementary materials and ( <ref type=\"formula\">25</ref>)].</p><p>In total, there were 488 articles in the 2008 issues of the three journals. One hundred fiftyeight of these (32%) became eligible for selection for replication during the project period, between November 2011 and December 2014. From those, 111 articles (70%) were selected by a replication team, producing 113 replications. Two articles had two replications each (supplementary materials). And 100 of those (88%) replications were completed by the project deadline for inclusion in this aggregate report. After being claimed, some studies were not completed because the replication teams ran out of time or could not devote sufficient resources to completing the study. By journal, replications were completed for 39 of 64 (61%) articles from PSCI, 31 of 55 (56%) articles from JPSP, and 28 of 39 (72%) articles from JEP:LMC.</p><p>The most common reasons for failure to match an article with a team were feasibility constraints for conducting the research. Of the 47 articles from the eligible pool that were not claimed, six (13%) had been deemed infeasible to replicate because of time, resources, instrumentation, dependence on historical events, or hard-to-access samples. The remaining 41 (87%) were eligible but not claimed. These often required specialized samples (such as macaques or people with autism), resources (such as eye tracking machines or functional magnetic resonance imaging), or knowledge making them difficult to match with teams.</p></div>\n",
            "<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>Aggregate data preparation</head><p>Each replication team conducted the study, analyzed their data, wrote their summary report, and completed a checklist of requirements for sharing the materials and data. Then, independent reviewers and analysts conducted a projectwide audit of all individual projects, materials, data, and reports. A description of this review is available on the OSF (<ref type=\"url\" target=\"https://osf.io/xtine\">https://osf.io/xtine</ref>). Moreover, to maximize reproducibility and accuracy, the analyses for every replication study were reproduced by another analyst independent of the replication team using the R statistical programming language and a standardized analytic format. A controller R script was created to regenerate the entire analysis of every study and recreate the master data file. This R script, available at <ref type=\"url\" target=\"https://osf.io/fkmwg\">https://osf.io/fkmwg</ref>, can be executed to reproduce the results of the individual studies. A comprehensive description of this reanalysis process is available publicly (<ref type=\"url\" target=\"https://osf.io/a2eyg\">https://osf.io/a2eyg</ref>).</p></div>\n",
            "<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>Measures and moderators</head><p>We assessed features of the original study and replication as possible correlates of reproducibility and conducted exploratory analyses to inspire further investigation. These included characteristics of the original study such as the publishing journal; original effect size, P value, and sample size; experience and expertise of the original research team; importance of the effect, with indicators such as the citation impact of the article; and rated surprisingness of the effect. We also assessed characteristics of the replication such as statistical power and sample size, experience and expertise of the replication team, independently assessed challenge of conducting an effective replication, and self-assessed quality of the replication effort. Variables such as the P value indicate the statistical strength of evidence given the null hypothesis, and variables such as \"effect surprisingness\" and \"expertise of the team\" indicate qualities of the topic of study and the teams studying it, respectively. The master data file, containing these and other variables, is available for exploratory analysis (<ref type=\"url\" target=\"https://osf.io/5wup8\">https://osf.io/5wup8</ref>).</p><p>It is possible to derive a variety of hypotheses about predictors of reproducibility. To reduce the likelihood of false positives due to many tests, we aggregated some variables into summary indicators: experience and expertise of original team, experience and expertise of replication team, challenge of replication, self-assessed quality of repli-cation, and importance of the effect. We had no a priori justification to give some indicators stronger weighting over others, so aggregates were created by standardizing [mean (M) = 0, SD = 1] the individual variables and then averaging to create a single index. In addition to the publishing journal and subdiscipline, potential moderators included six characteristics of the original study and five characteristics of the replication (supplementary materials).</p></div>\n",
            "<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>Publishing journal and subdiscipline</head><p>Journals' different publishing practices may result in a selection bias that covaries with reproducibility. Articles from three journals were made available for selection: JPSP (n = 59 articles), JEP: LMC (n = 40 articles), and PSCI (n = 68 articles). From this pool of available studies, replications were selected and completed from JPSP (n = 32 studies), JEP:LMC (n = 28 studies), and PSCI (n = 40 studies) and were coded as representing cognitive (n = 43 studies) or social-personality (n = 57 studies) subdisciplines. Four studies that would ordinarily be understood as \"developmental psychology\" because of studying children or infants were coded as having a cognitive or social emphasis. Reproducibility may vary by subdiscipline in psychology because of differing practices. For example, within-subjects designs are more common in cognitive than social psychology, and these designs often have greater power to detect effects with the same number of participants.</p></div>\n",

We evaluated reproducibility using significance and P values, effect sizes, subjective assessments of replication teams, and meta-analyses of effect sizes. All five of these indicators contribute information about the relations between the replication and original finding and the cumulative evidence about the effect and were positively correlated with one another (r ranged from 0.22 to 0.96, median r = 0.57). Results are summarized in Table <ref type=\"table\">1</ref>, and full details of analyses are in the supplementary materials.</p></div>\n",
            "<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>Significance and P values</head><p>Assuming a two-tailed test and significance or a level of 0.05, all test results of original and replication studies were classified as statistically significant (P ≤ 0.05) and nonsignificant (P &gt; 0.05). However, original studies that interpreted nonsignificant P values as significant were coded as significant (four cases, all with P values &lt; 0.06). Using only the nonsignificant P values of the replication studies and applying Fisher's method <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b25\">(26)</ref>, we tested the hypothesis that these studies had \"no evidential value\" (the null hypothesis of zero-effect holds for all these studies). We tested the hypothesis that the proportions of statistically significant results in the original and replication studies are equal using the McNemar test for paired nominal data and calculated a CI of the reproducibility parameter. Second, we compared the central tendency of the distribution of P values of original and replication studies using the Wilcoxon signedrank test and the t test for dependent samples. For both tests, we only used study-pairs for which both P values were available.</p></div>\n",
            "<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>Effect sizes</head><p>We transformed effect sizes into correlation coefficients whenever possible. Correlation coefficients have several advantages over other effect size measures, such as Cohen's d. Correlation coefficients are bounded, well known, and therefore more readily interpretable. Most important for our purposes, analysis of correlation coefficients is straightforward because, after ap-plying the Fisher transformation, their standard error is only a function of sample size. Formulas and code for converting test statistics z, F, t, and c 2 into correlation coefficients are provided in the appendices at <ref type=\"url\" target=\"http://osf.io/ezum7\">http://osf.io/ezum7</ref>. To be able to compare and analyze correlations across studypairs, the original study's effect size was coded as positive; the replication study's effect size was coded as negative if the replication study's effect was opposite to that of the original study.</p><p>We compared effect sizes using four tests. We compared the central tendency of the effect size distributions of original and replication studies using both a paired two-sample t test and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Third, we computed the proportion of study-pairs in which the effect of the original study was stronger than in the replication study and tested the hypothesis that this proportion is 0.5. For this test, we included findings for which effect size measures were available but no correlation coefficient could be computed (for example, if a regression coefficient was reported but not its test statistic). Fourth, we calculated \"coverage,\" or the proportion of study-pairs in which the effect of the original study was in the CI of the effect of the replication study, and compared this with the expected proportion using a goodness-of-fit c 2 test.

This dichotomous vote-counting method is intuitively appealing and consistent with common heuristics used to decide whether original studies \"worked.\" Ninety-seven of 100 (97%) effects from original studies were positive results (four had P values falling a bit short of the 0.05 criterion-P = 0.0508, 0.0514, 0.0516, and 0.0567but all of these were interpreted as positive effects). On the basis of only A key weakness of this method is that it treats the 0.05 threshold as a bright-line criterion between replication success and failure <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b27\">(28)</ref>. It could be that many of the replications fell just short of the 0.05 criterion. The density plots of P values for original studies (mean P value = 0.028) and replications (mean P value = 0.302) are shown in Fig. <ref type=\"figure\">1</ref>, left. The 64 nonsignificant P values for replications were distributed widely. When there is no effect to detect, the null distribution of P values is uniform. This distribution deviated slightly from uniform with positive skew, however, suggesting that at least one replication could be a false negative, c 2 (128) = 155.83, P = 0.048. Nonetheless, the wide distribution of P values suggests against insufficient power as the only explanation for failures to replicate. A scatterplot of original compared with replication study P values is shown in Fig. <ref type=\"figure\">2</ref>.</p></div>\n",

For the subset of 73 studies in which the standard error of the correlation could be computed, 30 (41.1%) of the replication CIs contained the original effect size (significantly lower than the expected value of 78.5%, P &lt; 0.001) (supplementary materials). For 22 studies using other test statistics [F(df 1 &gt; 1, df 2 ) and c 2 ], 68.2% of CIs contained the effect size of the original study. Overall, this analysis suggests a 47.4% replication success rate.</p><p>This method addresses the weakness of the first test that a replication in the same direction and a P value of 0.06 may not be significantly different from the original result. However, the method will also indicate that a replication \"fails\" when the direction of the effect is the same but the replication effect size is significantly smaller than the original effect size <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b28\">(29)</ref>. Also, the replication \"succeeds\" when the result is near zero but not estimated with sufficiently high precision to be distinguished from the original effect size.</p></div>\n",

Overall, original study effect sizes (M = 0.403, SD = 0.188) were reliably larger than replication effect sizes (M = 0.197, SD = 0.257), Wilcoxon's W = 7137, P &lt; 0.001. Of the 99 studies for which an effect size in both the original and replication study could be calculated <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b29\">(30)</ref>, 82 showed a stronger effect size in the original study (82.8%; P &lt; 0.001, binomial test) (Fig. <ref type=\"figure\">1</ref>, right).

In a discipline with low-powered research designs and an emphasis on positive results for publication, effect sizes will be systematically overestimated in the published literature. There is no publication bias in the replication studies because all results are reported. Also, there are no selection or reporting biases because all were confirmatory tests based on pre-analysis plans. This maximizes the interpretability of the replication P values and effect estimates. If publication, selection, and reporting biases completely explain the effect differences, then the replication estimates would be a better estimate of the effect size than would the metaanalytic and original results. However, to the extent that there are other influences, such as moderation by sample, setting, or quality of replication, the relative bias influencing original and replication effect size estimation is unknown.</p></div>\n",

Considering significance testing, reproducibility was stronger in studies and journals representing cognitive psychology than social psychology topics. For example, combining across journals, 14 of 55 (25%) of social psychology effects replicated by the P &lt; 0.05 criterion, whereas 21 of 42 (50%) of cognitive psychology effects did so. Simultaneously, all journals and disciplines showed substantial and similar [c 2 (3) = 2.45, P = 0.48] declines in effect size in the replications compared with the original studies. The difference in significance testing results between fields appears to be partly a function of weaker original effects in social psychology studies, particularly in JPSP, and perhaps of the greater frequency of high-powered within-subjects manipulations and repeated measurement designs in cognitive psychology as suggested by high power despite relatively small participant samples. Further, the type of test was associated with replication success. Among original, significant effects, 23 of the 49 (47%) that tested main or simple effects replicated at P &lt; 0.05, but just 8 of the 37 (22%) that tested interaction effects did.</p><p>Correlations between reproducibility indicators and characteristics of replication and original studies are provided in Table <ref type=\"table\">2</ref>. A negative correlation of replication success with the original study P value indicates that the initial strength of evidence is predictive of reproducibility. For example, 26 of 63 (41%) original studies with P &lt; 0.02 achieved P &lt; 0.05 in the replication, whereas 6 of 23 (26%) that had a P value between 0.02 &lt; P &lt; 0.04 and 2 of 11 (18%) that had a P value &gt; 0.04 did so (Fig. <ref type=\"figure\">2</ref>). Almost two thirds (20 of 32, 63%) of original studies with P &lt; 0.001 had a significant P value in the replication.</p><p>Larger original effect sizes were associated with greater likelihood of achieving P &lt; 0.05 (r = 0.304) and a greater effect size difference between original and replication (r = 0.279). Moreover, replication power was related to replication success via significance testing (r = 0.368) but not with the effect size difference between original and replication (r = -0.053). Comparing effect sizes across indicators, surprisingness of the original effect, and the challenge of conducting the replication were related to replication success for some indicators. Surprising effects were less reproducible, as were effects for which it was more challenging to conduct the replication. Last, there was little evidence that perceived importance of the effect, expertise of the original or replication teams, or self-assessed quality of the replication accounted for meaningful variation in reproducibility across indicators. Replication success was more consistently related to the original strength of evidence (such as original P value, effect size, and effect tested) than to characteristics of the teams and implementation of the replication (such as expertise, quality, or challenge of conducting study) (tables S3 and S4).</p></div>\n",
            "<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>Discussion</head><p>No single indicator sufficiently describes replication success, and the five indicators examined here are not the only ways to evaluate reproducibility. Nonetheless, collectively, these results offer a clear conclusion: A large portion of replications produced weaker evidence for the original findings (31) despite using materials provided by the original authors, review in advance for methodological fidelity, and high statistical power to detect the original effect sizes. Moreover, correlational evidence is consistent with the conclusion that variation in the strength of initial evidence (such as original P value) was more predictive of replication success than was variation in the characteristics of the teams conducting the research (such as experience and expertise). The latter factors certainly can influence replication success, but the evidence is that they did not systematically do so here. Other investigators may develop alternative indicators to explore further the role of expertise and quality in reproducibility on this open data set.</p></div>\n",
            "<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>Insights on reproducibility</head><p>It is too easy to conclude that successful replication means that the theoretical understanding of the original finding is correct. Direct replication mainly provides evidence for the reliability of a result. If there are alternative explanations for the original finding, those alternatives could likewise account for the replication. Understanding is achieved through multiple, diverse investigations that provide converging support for a theoretical interpretation and rule out alternative explanations.</p><p>It is also too easy to conclude that a failure to replicate a result means that the original evidence was a false positive. Replications can fail if the replication methodology differs from the original in ways that interfere with observing the effect. We conducted replications designed to minimize a priori reasons to expect a different result by using original materials, engaging original authors for review of the designs, and conducting internal reviews. Nonetheless, unanticipated factors in the sample, setting, or procedure could still have altered the observed effect magnitudes <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b31\">(32)</ref>.</p><p>More generally, there are indications of cultural practices in scientific communication that may be responsible for the observed results. Lowpower research designs combined with publication bias favoring positive results together produce a literature with upwardly biased effect sizes <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b13\">(14,</ref><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b15\">16,</ref><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b32\">33,</ref><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b33\">34)</ref>. This anticipates that replication effect sizes would be smaller than original studies on a routine basis-not because of differences in implementation but because the original study effect sizes are affected by publication and reporting bias, and the replications are not. Consistent with this expectation, most replication effects were smaller than original results, and reproducibility success was correlated with indicators of the strength of initial evidence, such as lower original P values and larger effect sizes. This suggests publication, selection, and reporting biases as plausible explanations for the difference between original and replication effects. The replication studies significantly reduced these biases because replication preregistration and pre-analysis plans ensured confirmatory tests and reporting of all results.</p><p>The observed variation in replication and original results may reduce certainty about the statistical inferences from the original studies but also provides an opportunity for theoretical innovation to explain differing outcomes, and then new research to test those hypothesized explanations. The correlational evidence, for example, suggests that procedures that are more challenging to execute may result in less reproducible results, and that more surprising original effects may be less reproducible than less surprising original effects. Further, systematic, repeated replication efforts that fail to identify conditions under which the original finding can be observed reliably may reduce confidence in the original finding.</p></div>\n",
            "<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>Implications and limitations</head><p>The present study provides the first open, systematic evidence of reproducibility from a sample of studies in psychology. We sought to maximize generalizability of the results with a structured process for selecting studies for replication. However, it is unknown the extent to which these findings extend to the rest of psychology or other disciplines. In the sampling frame itself, not all articles were replicated; in each article, only one study was replicated; and in each study, only one statistical result was subject to replication. More resource-intensive studies were less likely to be included than were less resource-intensive studies. Although study selection bias was reduced by the sampling frame and selection strategy, the impact of selection bias is unknown.</p><p>We investigated the reproducibility rate of psychology not because there is something special about psychology, but because it is our discipline. Concerns about reproducibility are widespread across disciplines (9-21). Reproducibility is not well understood because the incentives for individual scientists prioritize novelty over replication <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b19\">(20)</ref>. If nothing else, this project demonstrates that it is possible to conduct a large-scale examination of reproducibility despite the incentive barriers. Here, we conducted single-replication attempts of many effects obtaining broad-and-shallow evidence. These data provide information about reproducibility in general but little precision about individual effects in particular. A complementary narrow-and-deep approach is characterized by the Many Labs replication projects <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b31\">(32)</ref>. In those, many replications of single effects allow precise estimates of effect size but result in generalizability that is circumscribed to those individual effects. Pursuing both strategies across disciplines, such as the ongoing effort in cancer biology <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b34\">(35)</ref>, would yield insight about common and distinct aac4716-6 challenges and may cross-fertilize strategies so as to improve reproducibility. Because reproducibility is a hallmark of credible scientific evidence, it is tempting to think that maximum reproducibility of original results is important from the onset of a line of inquiry through its maturation. This is a mistake. If initial ideas were always correct, then there would hardly be a reason to conduct research in the first place. A healthy discipline will have many false starts as it confronts the limits of present understanding.</p><p>Innovation is the engine of discovery and is vital for a productive, effective scientific enterprise. However, innovative ideas become old news fast. Journal reviewers and editors may dismiss a new test of a published idea as unoriginal. The claim that \"we already know this\" belies the uncertainty of scientific evidence. Deciding the ideal balance of resourcing innovation versus verification is a question of research efficiency. How can we maximize the rate of research progress? Innovation points out paths that are possible; replication points out paths that are likely; progress relies on both. The ideal balance is a topic for investigation itself. Scientific incentives-funding, publication, or awards-can be tuned to encourage an optimal balance in the collective effort of discovery <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b35\">(36,</ref><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b36\">37)</ref>.</p><p>Progress occurs when existing expectations are violated and a surprising result spurs a new investigation. Replication can increase certainty when findings are reproduced and promote innovation when they are not. This project provides accumulating evidence for many findings in psychological research and suggests that there is still more work to do to verify whether we know what we think we know.</p></div>\n",
            "<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>Conclusion</head><p>After this intensive effort to reproduce a sample of published psychological findings, how many of the effects have we established are true? Zero. And how many of the effects have we established are false? Zero. Is this a limitation of the project design? No. It is the reality of doing science, even if it is not appreciated in daily practice. Humans desire certainty, and science infrequently provides it. As much as we might wish it to be otherwise, a single study almost never provides definitive resolution for or against an effect and its explanation. The original studies examined here offered tentative evidence; the replications we conducted offered additional, confirmatory evidence. In some cases, the replications increase confidence in the reliability of the original results; in other cases, the replications suggest that more investigation is needed to establish the validity of the original findings. Scientific progress is a cumulative process of uncertainty reduction that can only succeed if science itself remains the greatest skeptic of its explanatory claims.</p><p>The present results suggest that there is room to improve reproducibility in psychology. Any temptation to interpret these results as a defeat for psychology, or science more generally, must contend with the fact that this project demon-strates science behaving as it should. Hypotheses abound that the present culture in science may be negatively affecting the reproducibility of findings. An ideological response would discount the arguments, discredit the sources, and proceed merrily along. The scientific process is not ideological. Science does not always provide comfort for what we wish to be; it confronts us with what is. Moreover, as illustrated by the Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) Guidelines (<ref type=\"url\" target=\"http://cos.io/top\">http://cos.io/top</ref>) <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b36\">(37)</ref>, the research community is taking action already to improve the quality and credibility of the scientific literature.</p><p>We conducted this project because we care deeply about the health of our discipline and believe in its promise for accumulating knowledge about human behavior that can advance the quality of the human condition. Reproducibility is central to that aim. Accumulating evidence is the scientific community's method of self-correction and is the best available option for achieving that ultimate goal: truth. P.

            "Abstract: \n",
            " The Affect Misattribution Procedure (AMP) is used in many areas of psychological science based on the assumption that it not only taps into attitudes and biases but does so without a person's awareness. Across eight preregistered studies (N = 1603) plus meta-analyses, we reexamined the 'implicitness' of AMP effects, and in particular, the idea that people are unaware of the prime's influence on their evaluations. Results indicated that AMP effects and their predictive validity are primarily moderated by a subset of influence-aware trials (within individuals), and high rates of influence awareness (between individuals). Interestingly, an individual's influence-awareness rate on one AMP predicted how they performed on an earlier AMP, even when the two assessed different attitude domains. Taken together, our results suggest that AMP effects are not implicit in the way that has been claimed, a finding that has implications for the procedure, past findings, and theory.

            " Over the past 20 years, research on implicit cognition has grown from a relatively niche field into what is today, one of the most prolific and widely examined topics in psychological science. The idea that our automatic thoughts, feelings, and actions shape downstream behavior drives research, theory, and application throughout the discipline, especially in social and personality psychology, neuroscience, health, cognitive, and clinical psychology (for a book length treatment see  Gawronski & Payne, 2010) . The success of the topic has been due in large part to the development and widespread use of tasks known as indirect measurement procedures. In contrast to direct measurement procedures, which simply ask people to report on their thoughts, feelings, and actions, indirect procedures seek to probe the mind by interpreting performance (e.g., speed and/ or accuracy) on experimental paradigms. Notable examples include the Implicit Association Test (IAT:  Greenwald et al., 1998) , evaluative priming tasks  (Hermans et al., 1994) , and approach-avoidance tasks  (Rinck & Becker, 2007 ; for a review see  Gawronski & De Houwer, 2014) . The outcomes of these procedures are commonly referred to as implicit measures (e.g., the IAT effect, priming effects; for more see  De Houwer, 2006) . Indirect procedures are often deployed under the assumption that they limit a person's ability to control how they respond, or their need for introspective access and/or conscious awareness of the content under investigation (i.e., that they operate under the conditions of automaticity). As a result, these tasks are typically used when researchers want to gain insight into content that people may be unwilling or unable to report (see  Greenwald et al., 1998; Hahn & Gawronski, 2019) . Although debate continues about what implicit measures actually reflect  (Brownstein et al., 2019; Corneille & Hütter, 2020; Schimmack, 2021) , a vast and ever-increasing number of studies continue to rely on indirect procedures and their effects to provide insights that other (self-report) procedures cannot. \n",
            " The Affect Misattribution Procedure The Affect Misattribution Procedure (AMP) has emerged as one of the more popular indirect procedures (see  Payne & Lundberg, 2014) . At its core, the AMP consists of trials made up of three elements: (a) a prime stimulus (e.g., an image of a social ingroup member) which is first flashed on screen for a brief period of time, followed quickly by (b) a target stimulus (usually a neutral Chinese pictograph), which is subsequently masked by (c) a white noise image. The AMP requires participants to subjectively evaluate how visually pleasing the target stimulus is, while ignoring the prime that preceded it. Despite being explicitly told to disregard the prime when evaluating the target, people nonetheless evaluate the latter in ways that are consistent with the valence of the former. For instance, when a neutral Chinese pictograph is preceded by a social in-group member, people are more likely to evaluate it as pleasant, compared to when it is preceded by a social out-group member  (Payne et al., 2005) . Since its creation, the AMP has attracted considerable attention. It is commonly used in social psychology to assess attitudes in domains such as race  (Payne et al., 2005; Ditonto et al., 2013;  although see  Teige-Mocigemba et al., 2017) , gender  (Ye & Gawronski, 2018) , sexuality  (Imhoff et al., 2011) , and politics  (Kalmoe & Piston, 2013; Payne et al., 2005) . It has been used to investigate the origins of attitudes and stereotypes  (Dunham & Emony, 2014; Mann et al., 2019; Van Dessel et al., 2017) , and to assess the effectiveness of attitude change interventions  (Mann & Ferguson, 2017) . In clinical psychology, it is used to assess, and sometimes provide prospective prediction of, maladaptive behaviors such as eating disorders, non-suicidal self-injury, alcoholism, anxiety, depressive symptoms, and physical abuse  (Fox et al., 2018; Görgen et al., 2015; Jasper & Witthöft, 2013; McCarthy et al., 2017; Smith et al., 2018; Zerhouni et al., 2018) . Some clinical researchers also use the task as an outcome measure to benchmark the effectiveness of psychological interventions  (Chapman et al., 2018; Schreiber et al., 2016) . \n",
            " Two competing accounts of the AMP effect Two distinct perspectives have emerged to explain the aforementioned effects: an implicit account and an explicit account. 1 Both start from the position that AMP effects represent a valid measure of attitudes and bias. However, they differ in how \"implicit\" or \"automatic\" those effects are said to be. On the one hand, the implicit account argues that AMP effects reflect evaluations captured under certain conditions of automaticity (i.e., specifically, in the absence of intention and awareness;  Payne et al., 2005; Payne et al., 2013) . On the other hand, the explicit account rejects this idea and argues that participants are aware of the prime's influence on their evaluations, and exert intentional control over their behavior in order to respond in-line with those primes (e.g.,  Bar-Anan & Nosek, 2012; Mann et al., 2019) . In what follows, we briefly consider research that has examined the issues of awareness and intention of AMP effects. \n",
            " Intentionality in the AMP The idea that participants intentionally rely on the prime when evaluating the target can be argued on the basis of several studies. For instance,  Bar-Anan and Nosek (2012)  asked participants to first complete an AMP and then retrospectively indicate if they had intentionally based their evaluations on the prime rather the target. They found that AMP effects were moderated by those who retrospectively reported intentionally rating the primes. Across a series of studies,  Weil and colleagues (2017)  exposed participants to either a bogus subliminal presentation task that falsely claimed to show certain targets (Chinese ideographs), or a genuine supraliminal presentation task that actually did so. Thereafter they completed an AMP. Half of the sample were told to evaluate the valence of the targets whereas the other half were asked to evaluate them in terms of their familiarity. Once the AMP was complete, participants completed similar post hoc intention questions as in  Bar-Anan and Nosek (2012) . Replicating  Bar-Anan and Nosek (2012) , AMP scores were positively correlated with intention ratings in the valence-judgment condition (but not in the familiarity condition) (also see  Mann et al., 2019 , for additional evidence on the role of intentionality in AMP effects).  2 Proponents of the implicit account conducted several experiments which rejected these claims. For instance,  Payne et al. (2013)  found that the relationship between intentionality ratings and AMP effects was similar when people had to indicate if they were intentionally or unintentionally influenced by the prime. Drawing on this finding, they claimed that people may be able to identify that they acted in a particular way, but they are unable to say why they acted in this way. In a second experiment, participants were asked to complete the AMP twice: once where 1 The term 'implicit' does not represent an all-or-nothing concept, but rather is an umbrella term that refers to a set of automaticity conditions under which mental processes are said to operate (see  Moors & De Houwer, 2006) . The effects obtained from an indirect procedure are assumed to occur under one or more of these automaticity conditions. Thus to describe a measure or effect as implicit requires that one is clear about the exact automaticity conditions relevant to that effect. For those looking for an extensive debate about the meaning and usefulness of the term implicit, we recommend  Corneille and Hütter (2020) . they had to evaluate the target instead of prime (standard 'unintentional' AMP) and once where they had to evaluate the prime instead of the target (an 'intentional' AMP).  3 The authors found that the relationship between standard AMP and personality judgements of a Black person were different to the relationship between the intentional AMP and that same personality judgement. These results and others (e.g.,  Gawronski & Ye, 2014)  have been advanced in support of the idea that AMP effects are unintentional in nature. In short, a number of studies investigating intentionality within the AMP have been carried out and debates continues as to whether AMP effects qualify as unintentional in nature. \n",
            " Awareness in the AMP The implicit and explicit accounts also differ in how awareness and AMP effects are thought to be related to one another. Although both acknowledge that people can be aware that the prime has influenced their response to the target, they differ in the causal vs. correlational role that awareness is assumed to play. Proponents of the implicit account argue that awareness may be correlated with, but is not causally required to demonstrate, AMP effects, whereas proponents of the explicit account argue that participants are aware of the influence of the primes on their responses, and that it is possible this awareness is causally related to those effects. For instance, Bar-Anan and Nosek (2012) asked participants in a self-reported (post hoc) manner if they were aware of the prime's influence on their target evaluations. Across multiple studies they found that post hoc, selfreported awareness predicted AMP effect sizes. That is, participants who reported no priming effect produced AMP effects that were psychometrically poor (no significant split-half correlation and no relationship with any of the other attitude measures) whereas those who reported being aware that priming had occurred showed stronger priming effects, split-half correlations, and relationships with other attitude measures.  Payne et al. (2013)  responded to the above work. In one study (Experiment 3), they divided participants into two groups: the first completed a standard AMP, whereas the second completed a 'skip' AMP. During the latter AMP, participants were given the option to respond in one of three ways: they could either indicate that the target stimulus was pleasant, unpleasant, or choose to 'skip' that trial entirely if they felt that their evaluation would have been influenced by the prime. The authors argued that if AMP effects were due to responding on trials where participants were aware of the prime's influence on their evaluations, then removing such trials \"should eliminate the priming effect\" (p. 377). When they compared skip-AMP effects (where influence-aware trials had been removed) to standard AMP effects, they found that the former did not significantly differ from the latter. \n",
            " Awareness revisited The aforementioned study by  Payne et al. (2013)  is often viewed as strong evidence in favor of the idea that AMP effects occur without awareness and are therefore implicit along this dimension. We believe that this assumption may be premature for several reasons. \n",
            " Methodological issues On the surface, the 'skip' AMP developed by  Payne et al. (2013)  appears to provide an in vivo measure of awareness insofar as participants are provided with an option to signal that the prime has influenced their evaluations. Such an approach is certainly more favorable than a single post hoc self-report measure administered once the task is complete. However, even this task has its issues. Foremost amongst these is that it requires people to make an either/or decision: either provide an evaluative response or indicate that they were aware of the prime's influence, but it never allows one to do both (i.e., respond to the target and indicate this was a 'contaminated' response). This makes it impossible to directly compare performance on trials where people indicated that they were influence-aware to those trials where they were non-influence-aware. Without both pieces of information, it is difficult to determine whether trial-by-trial influence awareness moderates the magnitude of the AMP effect, or how AMP effects calculated from only influence-aware trials compare to those calculated from non-influence-aware trials.  Payne et al. (2013;  Experiment 3) also argued that effects on the standard AMP did not differ from those on the 'skip' AMP, and used this as evidence in support of the implicit account. Yet this conclusion is also problematic given that non-significant statistical differences between two means does not necessarily imply that they are statistically equivalent  (Lakens et al., 2018; Quertemont, 2011) . As such, the original inference drawn was not supported by the analyses that were conducted in the paper. \n",
            " Statistical issues \n",
            " Conceptual issues Finally, the authors noted that participants tended to skip trials more frequently on trials with neutral compared to valenced primes, and suggested that such a pattern could be explained by the implicit but not the explicit account (i.e., that if people were aware they should skip when confronted with valenced primes and not with neutral primes). However, an explicit account can be formulated which assumes that AMP effects arise because a subset of participants, on a subset of trials, intentionally and with awareness, use the prime's valence to determine their response to the target. In cases where the prime is neutral, there is no evaluative information available which one can use to guide their response to the target. Thus it follows that they will skip more on such trials. The opposite is true on valenced prime trials and thus skipping should occur less frequently. \n",
            " Conclusion Given these conflicting accounts of the role of awareness in the AMP and a combination of methodological (absence of information about influence-aware trial performance), statistical (conflation of statistical non-significance and statistical equivalence), and conceptual issues (equally plausible explanation of findings by the explicit account) within certain studies, it seems reasonable to continue examining whether participants really are aware of the prime's influence on their evaluations. \n",
            " The current research Across eight preregistered studies (one replication and seven novel studies) we re-examined the implicitness of AMP effects and, in particular, the assertion that people are unaware of the prime's influence on their evaluations. In Experiment 1 we conducted a high-powered, preregistered study that sought to replicate the finding that standard and 'skip' AMPs are no different to one another. As we previously noted, the finding that 'skip' AMP effects are no different to standard AMP effects is viewed as strong support for the implicit account. To briefly preface what is to come, we found that scores on the standard AMP were significantly larger than those on the 'skip' AMP, a finding inconsistent with previously formulated implicit accounts. In Experiment 2 we sought to address a key limitation of the original 'skip' AMP -namely -that it forces people to either skip or evaluate the target and thus only provides partial data. We developed an influence-aware (IA-) AMP that had participants rate the target (provide evaluative information) and then indicate if evaluations had been influenced by the prime (provide influence information). We found that AMP effects were moderated at the trial-by-trial level by influence awareness, as well as by at the group level by interindividual differences in influence awareness. In Experiments 3 and 4, we controlled for the possibility that by probing for influence awareness on each trial of the IA-AMP we artificially altered the relationship between awareness and AMP effects. Participants now completed a standard AMP at Time 1 and an IA-AMP at Time 2, either from the same (Experiment 3, i.e., both generic valence) or different attitude domains (Experiment 4, i.e., one generic valence and one politics). In both cases, influence awareness during an IA-AMP at Time 2 were related to the magnitude of standard AMP effects at Time 1, suggesting that influence awareness is a stable (withinparticipant) pattern of responding that holds within and between content domains. In Experiment 5, we had two groups of participants (Democrats and Republicans) first complete a political IA-AMP and then an IA-AMP with generic valenced primes. We found that the AMP's ability to correctly classify a person as a Democrat or Republican was superior when effects were based solely on influenceaware trials and inferior when based solely on noninfluence-aware trials. Experiment 6 had participants first complete a newly developed version of the AMP that purportedly reduces subset effects within the AMP (the Mann et al., 2019 modifications to the AMP) followed by a Mann et al. IA-AMP. Once again, the same pattern of findings emerged as outlined above, even within a variant of the task designed to optimize the implicitness of the AMP. In our final two studies, we modified the IA-AMP so that influence awareness was measured prospectively, either before the target was evaluated (Experiment 7) or before the target stimulus was even presented (Experiment 8). In this way, influence awareness was measured before an overt evaluation took place or a covert evaluation could even be formed. In both studies, the same pattern of findings emerged as before (see Fig.  1 ). Taken together, our studies extend beyond previous work in this area by investigating awareness in both retrospective and prospective ways. They do so using multiple measures (single post hoc self-reports, trial-by-trial online measures), versions of the AMP (standard, Influence Aware version,  Mann et al. version) , and attitude domains (political, positive vs. negative). They explore the bidirectional relationship between performance on one AMP and that of another (something that has not been examined in prior awareness work), and examine how awareness plays out at the trial, individual, and group levels. The result is a level of generalizability about awareness in the AMP that extends beyond that which has come before. \n",
            " Experiment 1: Skip AMP effects differ from standard AMP effects In their original paper, Payne et al. reasoned that \"if a participant is aware when she is being influenced by a prime, then she can pass when she would otherwise display a priming effect. The trials on which he or she chooses to forego the pass option and evaluate the pictograph should therefore be free of influence from the primes. If subjective experiences of being influenced by the primes are well calibrated to actual influence, then the pass option should allow respondents to eliminate the priming effect.\" (p. 382). In other words, if awareness of influence of the prime is central to AMP effects, then effects on the standard version of the task should be larger than effects on the skip variant. The authors found no statistically significant difference between the two task variants and concluded that \"these data contradict the idea that participants were aware that the primes influenced them before responding\" (p. 383). In Experiment 1, we examined if this claim (that 'skip' AMP effects do not differ from standard AMP effects) is replicable. We first carried out power analyses (detailed below) to ensure that we had sufficient power to detect even small effects (something that may have presented a problem in the original study). 4 We then administered similar standard and skip AMPs as used by  Payne et al. (2013) . Whereas the original authors relied on a betweensubjects manipulation, we opted to administer both AMP variants to all participants in order to improve our statistical power, as well as to better compare effect sizes within rather than between individuals. We also carried out statistical comparisons that allowed us to test the original key claim (e.g., we used a partially overlapping t test to Fig.  1  A schematic overview of the AMP variants used in Experiments 1-8. The point within the trial at which awareness of influence of the prime on evaluations was systematically varied between studies 4 The sample size used in the authors original study was relatively small (N = 36 per cell). Although they argued that this sample would provide power \"greater than .85 to detect an interaction between the repeated measures and between-subjects factors, even assuming a small effect size\" (p. 383), they did not specify what effect size they qualified as \"small\", nor what they specified as the correlation between the different within-subject measurements (i.e., the correlation between evaluations of the positive and negative primes). This unspecified correlation can make such a power analysis vary widely. Combining this with the fact that their sample size was relatively small, it is very possible that a true difference between the AMP types exists, but the authors simply did not achieve sufficient power to detect such a difference. 1 3 account for participants who skip either all trials or no trials). In addition to the confirmatory analysis, we also asked an exploratory question: is one's awareness of the prime's influence on their evaluations (as indexed by skip rates in the skip AMP) related to the magnitude of their effect in a standard AMP? If so, then this would suggest that influence awareness may play more of a role in standard AMP effects than previously thought. \n",

Given that a partially overlapping t test's power typically falls somewhere between a paired-samples t test and a two-sample t test  (Derrick et al., 2017) , 289 participants would provide (a) at least 95% power to detect a small effect size in such a test and (b) power to detect a very small Cohen's f effect size (i.e., 0.045) in a linear regression with one dependent variable and one independent variable (i.e., the analysis used to investigate our second question). \n",

            " Materials Materials were programmed in Inquisit 4.0 and administered via the Inquisit Web Player. Both versions of the AMP contained three types of stimuli: primes, targets, and a mask. Prime stimuli consisted of 12 positive and 12 negative images taken from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS;  Lang et al., 1997) . Target stimuli consisted of 72 Chinese pictographs and the mask consisted of a white noise image (see  https:// osf . io/ p6e3c/ for the valenced items and Chinese pictographs used in this study). \n",
            " Procedure Participants initially provided informed consent and demographic information (age and gender) and then completed a standard AMP followed by a skip AMP. Standard AMP Prior to the task, participants were told that the study would examine how people make simple judgements. Pictures would appear one after another on the screen. The first would be a real-life image and the second a Chinese symbol. Their task was to judge the visual pleasantness of the Chinese symbol using the E (pleasant) and I (unpleasant) keys while trying their best to not let the real-life images bias those judgements. Overall, the task consisted of ten practice trials followed by 72 test trials. Each trial began with the presentation of a fixation cross for 500 ms, after which a positive or negative prime stimulus was presented for 100 ms, followed a blank screen for 100 ms and then a target image (i.e., a Chinese pictograph). The target remained onscreen for 100 ms, after which, a white noise image appeared and replaced the Chinese pictograph. This mask remained onscreen until the target stimulus was rated as positive or negative using the E or I keys, respectively. Skip AMP The skip AMP was similar to the standard AMP. Participants were informed that they would complete a similar task once again but with one important difference: that they could now respond in a third way -namely -to 'skip' a trial by pressing the spacebar whenever they thought their evaluations of the pictographs might be influenced by the prime. Instructions emphasized that they should only evaluate the pictograph whenever their opinion reflected the qualities of the pictograph itself. If their judgement was influenced by the prime, then they should skip that trial. The AMPs used in our conceptual replication were similar to those used by  Payne et al. (2013) , with two exceptions. First, we use 72 rather than 120 test trials in order to make online completion of two AMPs manageable for participants. Second, whereas Payne et al. used valenced and neutral primes, we only used valenced primes as -in the majority of AMP studies -only valenced primes are used. 5 \n",

            " Data exclusion Participants were excluded if they completed the experiment too quickly (i.e., in under 3 min) or provided incomplete data on any of the measures (n = 21). \n",
            " Data preparation AMP effects were computed by subtracting the proportion of 'pleasant' responses emitted on trials with an unpleasant prime from the proportion of 'pleasant' responses emitted on trials with a pleasant prime  (Payne et al., 2005) . Scores were calculated from all trials in the standard AMP and exclusively from the non-skipped trials in the skip AMP. \n",
            " Analytic strategy We carried out a partially overlapping t test to examine our first question (i.e., do AMP effects differ as a function of Task Type [standard vs. skip]). We opted for this test for the following reason: it may be that some participants recognized the prime's influence on their evaluations and therefore skipped all trials in the skip AMP. If so, then these individuals produced no AMP scores on this version of the task. One could simply exclude such participants in order to run a paired-sampled t test between skip and standard AMP scores. Yet skip-AMP effects are not missing at random and are instead missing for a very important reason (i.e., people are highly influenced). Excluding such individuals would undermine the inferences we ultimately want to make. The partially overlapping t test is a variant of the t test which overcomes this issue  (Derrick et al., 2017) . It is neither a dependent nor independent t test but rather a mixed t test containing independent and dependent data. Given that participants with an influence-awareness rate close to 100% had no skip AMP effect and therefore had no data for the skip AMP, their standard AMP effects were entered as independent data. Those with standard and skip AMP effects were entered as dependent data. We also investigated a second preregistered exploratory question: whether influence-awareness rates in the skip AMP predict the magnitude of effects in the standard AMP. To answer this question, we carried out a linear regression analysis with rate of skipping in the skip AMP as the independent variable and effects in the standard AMP as the dependent variable. All reported analyses were preregistered in this and all other studies unless otherwise noted. \n",
            " Hypothesis testing Do effects on the standard AMP differ from those on the skip AMP? Results indicated that effects in the standard AMP (M = 0.17, SD = 0.33) were significantly different from that of the skip AMP (M = -0.12, SD = 0.26), t(294) = 9.36, p < .001, M diff = 0.29. A between-subjects Cohen's d was also calculated for familiarity, although this should be interpreted with caution as it does not acknowledge the partial dependence within the data: d = 0.96, 95%  CI [0.79, 1.13] . Does the rate of skipping in the skip AMP predict standard AMP effects? Regression analyses indicated that rates of skipping in the skip AMP predicted the magnitude of effects in the standard AMP, B = 0.30, 95% CI [0.07, 0.53], β = .15, 95% CI [0.04; 0.26], p = .010. \n",
            " Discussion We did not replicate the finding that standard and skip AMP effects are similar to one another. Whereas  Payne et al. (2013; Experiment 3)  found no difference between a skip and standard AMP, we found a difference between the two, such that scores on the standard AMP were significantly larger than those on the skip AMP (which were also in the opposite direction to what the original authors found). Thus, it seems that people's subjective experiences during the skip AMP were well calibrated to the actual influence of the primes on their responses, and this allowed them to significantly reduce the priming effect. Even more interestingly, we found that a given participant's awareness of the prime's influence on their evaluations (during the skip AMP at Time 2) strongly predicted the magnitude of their effects in the standard AMP at Time 1. 6 This suggests 5 As we previously noted, we adopted a within participant design (participants first completed a standard AMP followed by a 'skip' AMP) whereas  Payne et al. (2013)  adopted a between participant design (participants completed either a standard AMP or a 'skip' AMP). 6 Throughout this article, we employ the word 'predict' in its statistical sense, i.e., the estimate scores on one task based on scores on another task. Our claims are agnostic to the temporal order of the tasks, which are based exclusively on the statistical relationship among scores on the tasks. Indeed, the temporal order of the tasks in our experiments were specifically chosen so that participants complete a standard and unaltered AMP before other tasks so as to exclude the possibility that performance on the standard AMP was altered or perturbed in any way by the other tasks. Elsewhere, when the dependent variable is completed prior to the independent variable, this is occasionally referred to as 'postdiction' rather than 'prediction', however we employ the latter for familiarity. that awareness of the prime's influence on evaluations may play a role in the standard AMP as well. \n",
            " Experiment 2: AMP effects are strongly related to awareness of the prime's influence on evaluations Although the skip AMP is an improvement on post hoc awareness measures, it is not without its issues. By forcing people to either skip or evaluate the target stimulus, the task can only provide partial data (i.e., either evaluations or indications of influence). A better task would be one where participants provide their evaluation of the target and indicate if that evaluations were influenced by the prime. Such a task would provide evaluative and prime-influence information for every participant on all trials and enable performance on the influence-aware trials to be directly compared to performance on the non-influence-aware trials, within rather than between participants. With this information, one can then quantify what contribution influence-aware vs. noninfluence-aware trials make to AMP effects. With this in mind, we designed a task known as the Influence-Awareness AMP or IA-AMP to investigate the following questions. First, would we observe an AMP effect for generic valenced primes? Second, and at the trial-by-trial level, are those effects moderated by a subset of trials, namely trials in which a participant is aware of the prime's influence on their evaluations? Third, are AMP effects at the group level moderated by inter-individual differences in awareness of influence of the primes? Fourth, does the \"on-line\" measure of awareness provided by the IA-AMP correlate with the post hoc selfreport awareness measures typically used in this literature? Finally, does influence awareness on the IA-AMP predict AMP effects better than post hoc self-report measures? \n",

            " IA-AMP Prior to the task participants received a similar set of instructions as in the skip AMP outlined in Experiment 1. These instructions emphasized that the first image (prime) that appears onscreen can sometimes bias judgements of the Chinese pictograph that follows, and that they should try their absolute best not to let this happen. After each trial, they would be able to indicate if their judgement of the Chinese pictograph had been influenced by the first image that appeared by pressing the spacebar. If not, then they simply had to wait for the following trial. The IA-AMP consisted of ten practice trials followed by 120 critical trials with similar parameters to the AMPs used in Experiment 1 (i.e., a fixation cross for 500 ms, a valenced prime stimulus for 100 ms, followed by a blank screen for 100 ms, a target Chinese pictograph for 100 ms, after which, a white noise image appeared and replaced that pictograph). At the end of each trial, participants were given the opportunity to press the spacebar to indicate that their evaluation had been influenced by the prime on that trial. Specifically, a cue to \"press spacebar if you felt you were influenced by the picture\" was presented after each evaluation was made. This cue remained onscreen for 2000 ms during which the spacebar could be pressed, followed by a 200-ms inter-trial interval and the next trial (note: this response window was fixed regardless of whether a response was emitted or not). Self-report awareness measure This measure was identical to that used in  Payne et al. (2013;  Experiment 1) and asked participants: \"to what extent were your ratings of the Chinese symbols influenced by the pictures that appeared immediately before those symbols?\". They could respond using on a seven-point Likert scale ranging from \"Never\" to \"Almost always\". foot_2   Exploratory questions Three exploratory questions were asked. The first centered on prime awareness (\"Think back to the task you just completed. On how many trials was a valenced picture presented before the Chinese character? It is important that you are honest here.\") using a scale ranging from 1 (None) to 7 (All). The second indexed intentional target stimulus responding (\"How often did you intentionally base your rating of the Chinese symbol on the image that immediately appeared before it?\"). The third centered on unintentional target stimulus responding (\"How often do you think that your rating of the Chinese symbol was unintentionally influenced by the pictures that appeared immediately before those symbols?\"). Both questions were responded to using a scale ranging from 1 (Never) to 7 (Almost always). Finally, we asked participants if we should exclude their data for any reason (e.g., computer malfunction or a distraction during the study). These items were exploratory in nature were not part of our preregistered analyses. \n",

Given our interest in the magnitude of IA-AMP effects, regardless of their directionality, all analyses on trial-bytrial level effects examined absolute values (i.e., the difference in evaluations between the prime types, agnostic to the direction of the effect). We also calculated influence rates for each participant in the IA-AMP by dividing the number of trials where they reported being influenced by the prime (i.e., by pressing the spacebar) by the total number of trials in the IA-AMP. foot_3   \n",
            " Analytic strategy A logistic mixed-effects model was used to investigate our first question (is there evidence for an AMP effect) and second question (at the trial-by-trial level, is prime-consistent evaluation moderated by influence awareness). We opted for mixed-effects models given that they offer superior statistical power compared to more commonly used fixed-effects alternatives. To address our third question (are AMP effects at the group level moderated by those participants who are more highly aware of the prime's influence), we scored IA-AMP effects for each participant (see below) and entered these into linear regression models. To compare online (IA-AMP) and offline (self-report) measures of influence awareness, correlational and regression analyses were used. \n",
            " Hypothesis testing Was there evidence for an AMP effect? A logistic mixedeffects model was carried out, with Valence Ratings (pleasant or unpleasant) of the target stimulus on each trial as the dependent variable, Prime Valence (pleasant or unpleasant) as the independent variable, and Participant as a random effect. This model acknowledges the non-independence of the multiple data points provided by each participant, trial type, and prime identity (i.e., the hierarchical nature of the data). Specifically, we modeled trial type as a random slope nested within a random intercept for participant, as well as modeling prime identity as a random intercept. Overall, an AMP effect emerged, such that participants were more likely to rate the target stimulus as positive when the prime valence was positive compared to when the prime valence was negative (and vice versa), OR = 3.69, 95% CI [2.81, 4.85], p < .001. The mean and standard deviations for standard and IA-AMP effects can be found in Tables  1  and 2 respectively.  Are AMP effects moderated by influence awareness at the trial level? We extended the above model by adding influence awareness on each trial (influence-aware vs. non-influence-aware) as a fixed effect. This allowed us to determine if the relationship between Valence Rating and Prime Valence was moderated by that subset of influenceaware trials. Results revealed an interaction between Prime Valence and influence awareness, such that AMP effects were far stronger on influence-aware trials, OR = 31.59, 95%  CI [24.79, 40.28] , p < .001. Are AMP effects moderated by those participants who are more influence-aware? We then sought to determine if AMP effects were moderated by those participants who were more frequently aware of the prime's influence on their evaluations (i.e., whether awareness rates varied between individuals and whether this variation was associated with the magnitude of the AMP effect). An 'awareness rate' score was calculated for each participant by dividing the number of 'aware' trials by the total number of trials completed (i.e., 120). A linear regression analysis with AMP effect size as the dependent variable and influence-awareness rate as a predictor variable was then conducted. Results indicated that influence-awareness rate was a significant predictor of AMP effect size, B = 0.42, 95% CI [0.31, 0.53], β = 0.53, 95% CI [0.39, 0.57], p < .001. Do online (IA-AMP) and post hoc (self-report) measures of awareness correlate with one another? Simple correlations revealed that the IA-AMP and post hoc awareness measures strongly associated with one another, B = 0.14, 95% CI [0.13, 0.16], β = 0.83, 95% CI [0.73, 0.92], p < .001. Does influence awareness on the IA-AMP predict AMP effects better than post hoc self-report measures? Regression analyses were once again conducted with the two awareness measures added into the model. This allowed us to determine their relative contribution in predicting AMP effects. Results indicated that only awareness assessed during the IA-AMP task predicted AMP effect sizes, B = 0.38, 95% CI [0.15, 0.61], β = 0.42, 95% CI [0.17, 0.67], p = .001; whereas awareness assessed after the task (post hoc selfreport) did not, B = 0.02, 95% CI [-0.02, 0.06], β = 0.12, 95% CI [-0.13, 0.37], p = .341). Comparison of the beta estimates' confidence intervals indicated that assessing for awareness during the task was a significantly better predictor of effects than doing so afterwards. \n",
            " Discussion The results from Experiment 2 are in-line with our preregistered hypotheses. AMP effects emerged and were moderated at the trial-by-trial level by performance on a subset of trials -namely -those where a participant was aware of the prime's influence on their evaluations. At the group level, AMP effects were moderated by participants who were highly influence aware and were significantly larger when calculated on the basis of the influence-aware trials compared to when calculated on the basis of the non-influenceaware trials. The online measure of awareness was a superior predictor of AMP effects than the offline measure. \n",
            " Experiment 3: Awareness assessed during an IA-AMP predicts the magnitude of effects on a previously completed standard AMP (in the same attitude domain) One question that comes to mind is how performance on the IA-AMP relates to performance on a standard AMP. It may be that asking about influence on every trial serves to artificially raise awareness of the prime as well as its influence on evaluations. This in turn may lead to a stronger relationship between awareness and AMP effects than would normally occur in the standard version of the task. Therefore, in Experiment 3 we sought to not only replicate our previous findings but also address this new question. Participants were asked to complete a standard AMP with generic valenced primes followed by an IA-AMP with similar stimuli (i.e., both task variants indexed attitudes from the same domain). This approach provided us with a baseline AMP effect for each participant that was unperturbed by awareness probes as well as a separate influence-awareness measure from that same person. If influence-awareness rates on an IA-AMP completed at Time 2 correlate with standard AMP effects obtained at Time 1 then this would suggest that influence awareness may also be central to the standard AMP as well. In short, Experiment 3 had both confirmatory and exploratory goals (all of which were preregistered). On the one hand, we sought to confirm our earlier findings (i.e., that AMP effects would emerge on the IA-AMP; that these effects would be moderated by performance on the influence-aware trials within a given individual, while at the group level, be moderated by highly aware participants). On the other hand, we also set out to explore the aforementioned question: would effects in the standard AMP be predicted by influence-awareness rates in the IA-AMP? Based on our previous findings, we predicted they would be. We then explored a third and final question: would there be a difference in the magnitude of standard AMP effects relative to IA-AMP effects that are exclusively comprised of 'non-influence-aware' trials? Recall that  Payne et al. (2013;  Experiment 3) asked a similar question when they compared scores on a standard AMP to those on a 'skip' AMP which was argued to provide a non-influence-aware measure of evaluations. Unlike those authors (who found no difference between the two measures), we predicted that standard AMP effects would be significantly larger than those obtained from an IA-AMP comprised of exclusively \"non-influence-aware\" trials, thus providing further support for the idea that influence awareness plays a role in standard AMP effects as well. \n",

A similar model was used to examine our first exploratory question (i.e., if influence-awareness rates on the IA-AMP predict effect sizes in a previously completed standard AMP).

Is there a difference in the magnitude of standard AMP effects and those based exclusively on non-influenced trials? Results from a partially overlapping t test (see Experiment 1) indicated that AMP effects based exclusively on non-influenced trials were significantly smaller than effects in the standard AMP, t(163.85) = 5.09, p < .001, M diff = 0.14.

            " Discussion Our findings replicated: AMP effects emerged and were moderated at the trial-by-trial level by performance on a subset of (influenced) trials, and at the group level by highly influence-aware participants. We also extended these findings by showing that influence awareness during an IA-AMP at Time 2 predicted the size of standard AMP effects completed at Time 1. This suggests that asking about influence awareness of a trial-by-trial basis does not artificially raise awareness of the prime and its influence on evaluations. If it did, then we would have expected no relationship between influence-awareness rates and standard AMP effects to 1 3 emerge, especially given that the IA-AMP was completed after the standard AMP. Yet influence-awareness rates were strongly predictive of standard AMP effects, suggesting that people may in fact be aware of the prime, and use that stimulus when forming an evaluation of the target. Finally, and in line with Experiment 1, we obtained further evidence that conflicts with the idea that standard and noninfluenced AMP effects do not differ from one another. Results indicated that AMP effects exclusively generated from noninfluenced trials were significantly smaller than standard AMP effects. These findings are consistent with what we observed in our direct replication attempt in Experiment 1 and converge on the same conclusion: AMP effects are stronger when participants are aware of the prime and its influence on evaluations. \n",
            " Experiment 4: Awareness assessed during an IA-AMP predicts the magnitude of effects on a previously completed standard AMP (in a different attitude domain) Experiment 4 represents an even stronger test of our claims. Imagine if participants first complete a standard AMP in one domain (political attitudes) and then complete an IA-AMP in a completely different domain (attitudes towards generic valenced stimuli). Now imagine if the same pattern of findings once again emerges. This would mean that a given participant's influence-awareness rates at Time 2 in one domain would be predicting the magnitude of their AMP effects at Time 1 in an entirely different domain. If so, then this would provide even stronger evidence that influence awareness is stable within individuals and moderates their task performance across AMPs in different attitude domains. With this in mind, we employed a similar design to Experiment 3 but with one change: we varied the attitude domains being assessed by the standard AMP (political attitudes towards Donald Trump vs. Barack Obama) and the IA-AMP (attitudes towards generic valenced stimuli as in Experiments 1-3). If influence-awareness rates reflect a stable (within-participant) pattern of responding regardless of content domain (politics vs. generic valenced primes), then influence-awareness rates in a positive/negative IA-AMP at Time 2 should still predict effect sizes within a standard political AMP completed at Time 1. \n",

Not only did influence awareness assessed by an IA-AMP retrospectively predict standard AMP effects, but it did so even when these tasks were assessing attitudes in entirely different domains. Taken together, Experiments 3 and 4 suggest that influence awareness is stable within individuals and moderates the magnitude of the AMP effect, even between attitude domains. It may be the case that, at least at the group level, the majority of the variance in AMP effects does not represent a measure of implicit evaluations in general, but rather the evaluations of a subset of individuals who are highly influence aware. We will return to this idea later on. \n",
            " Experiment 5: The AMP's predictive utility & influence awareness are strongly related Experiments 2-4 indicate that a subset of influence-aware trials strongly moderate AMP effects at the trial-by-trial level, and inter-individual differences in influence-aware rates moderate the magnitude of the AMP effect. Influenceawareness rates on one AMP predict how one will respond on another, and this is true when both tasks assess the same or different attitude domains. In Experiment 5, we set out to further replicate our findings while addressing three new questions. On the one hand, we wanted to know if influence awareness also played a key role in the AMP's predictive utility (i.e., its ability to discriminate between two known groups). We therefore recruited two groups of participants (Democrats and Republicans) and asked them to complete a political IA-AMP followed by a positive/negative IA-AMP. Our preregistered hypothesis was that the AMP's ability to predict whether a person was a Democrat or Republican would be higher when effects were solely derived from influence-aware trials and lower when they were derived from non-influence-aware trials. At the same time, we wanted to know if there was intraindividual stability in influence awareness from one AMP to another. Experiments 2-3 offered indirect evidence such that influence-awareness rates in the IA-AMP predicted the same person's scores in the standard AMP. However, a more direct demonstration requires that we have a measure of awareness on both tasks. We therefore examined if a participant's influence rate on one IA-AMP was correlated with their influence rate on a second IA-AMP. Finally, a unidirectional relationship between influence awareness and AMP effect sizes emerged in Experiments 2-4. However, given that we were now administering two IA-AMPs, we could also now test for a bidirectional relationship between these variables (i.e., if influence rates in AMP #1 predict effects in AMP #2, and if influence rates from AMP #2 predict effects in AMP #1). Demonstrating such a relationship would suggest that influence rates in general are predictive of AMP effects in general, yet further evidence supporting the idea that AMP effects are highly related to awareness of the primes and its influence on one's evaluations. \n",

Critical hypotheses: Does influence awareness moderate the AMP's predictive validity? Results indicated that the overall IA-AMP effect (i.e., an AMP including both types of trials) was d = 1.25, 95% CI [0.95, 1.55]. Effects based solely on influence-aware trials were superior in discriminating between Democrats and Republicans (d = 2.08, 95%  CI [1.62, 2.55] ) than effects based solely on the noninfluence-aware trials (d = 0.62, 95% CI [0.33, 0.91]), Q(df = 1) = 27.51, p < .001 (see Fig.  2 ). 11 Note that the confidence intervals of these three effects do not overlap, with influence-only AMP effects better at discriminating between 10 Note that in Experiments 2-4 we focused on the absolute magnitude of AMP effect sizes. Here in Experiment 5 we took the directionality of AMP effects into account when comparing the AMP scores of Republicans to those of Democrats. In all other cases, absolute AMP scores were assessed when testing hypotheses at the participant level. 11 Our preregistration stated that we would compare differences between these conditions via the confidence intervals on the two Cohen's d estimates. We subsequently discovered a method to produce a p value for this comparison via the metafor package's heterogeneity test. Both are reported and results are congruent across these analytic choices. individuals than an overall effect, which in turn was superior to a non-influence-aware effect. Are influence-awareness rates consistent within individuals and across different AMPs? Results revealed a strong correlation between influence-awareness rates in the two task variants, r = 0.82, 95% CI [0.77, 0.86], p < .001. Does influence awareness in one IA-AMP predict performance in another IA-AMP, and is this relationship bidirectional? Results indicated that influenceawareness rates in the politics IA-AMP predicted scores in the positive-negative IA-AMP, B = 0.46, 95% CI [0.36, 0.55], β = 0.54, 95% CI [0.42, 0.66], p < .001, and that influence-awareness rates in the positive-negative IA-AMP predicted scores in the politics IA-AMP, B = 0.49, 95% CI [0.38, 0.60], β = 0.52, 95% CI [0.40, 0.63], p < .001. It is also useful to consider the implications of these results in terms of temporal order rather than domain. Although it was not part of our original research plan, these results also suggest that the temporal order of the tasks, and therefore the order of assessment of the AMP effect versus the influence rate, does not matter. Participants always completed the politics IA-AMP first and the valence IA-AMP second. The influence rate in the politics IA-AMP (completed first) predicted the absolute magnitude of the valence IA-AMP (completed second), B = 0.46, 95% CI [0.36, 0.55]. Equally, the influence rate of the valence IA-AMP (completed second) predicted (or more accurately 'postdicted') the absolute magnitude of the politics IA-AMP (completed first), B = 0.49, 95% CI [0.38, 0.50]. The very similar estimates and strongly overlapping confidence intervals provide no evidence that order of presentation moderated the effect. \n",
            " Discussion Experiment 5 offers three new insights into the relationship between influence awareness and AMP effects. First, the predictive validity of AMP effects based solely on influenceaware trials is superior to that of effects based solely on non-influence-aware trials. Second, a given person's influence-awareness rate on one AMP is strongly correlated with their influence awareness on another AMP, even when those tasks are targeting entirely different domains. Third, the relationship between influence awareness and AMP scores is bidirectional, insofar as AMP effect sizes predict how influence aware one will later report being, and how influence aware one is at an earlier point in time will predict the later magnitude of their AMP effects. In short, these findings provide yet further support for the idea that (a) AMP effects are moderated by a subset of influence-aware trials and participants who are highly influenceaware, and (b) that the influence-aware participants who are mainly responsible for AMP effects in one domain are the same participants who are responsible for effects in another domain. They also imply that the AMP's predictive validity is strongly related to influence awareness. Although noninfluence-aware trials retain some degree of predictive validity, this pales in comparison to that of influence-aware trials. \n",

AMP is also moderated by influence awareness We are not the first to argue that AMP effects are strongly moderated by a well-defined subset of participants. In a recent review of the AMP literature,  Mann et al. (2019)  noted that data from AMP studies exhibit a strong bimodal distribution, with a subset of participants showing a very strong AMP effect, and the others producing scores that follow a normal distribution (for related arguments also see  Bar-Anan & Nosek, 2012) . Mann et al. argued that this cluster of extreme scoring participants (i.e., those who responsible for the bimodality) represent a small group of intentional responders, whereas the remaining participants reflect unintentional responders. They sought to eliminate the contaminating influence of these intentional responders (and thus reduce this bimodality) by creating a new and improved variant of the AMP. This task employed visually stimulating paintings as target stimuli, rather than the less visually stimulating Chinese pictographs, in order to increase the chances that participants would pay attention to the target rather than prime. They also included additional instructions imploring participants to avoid intentionally responding to the prime while reassuring them that it was acceptable if they sometimes did so. Mann et al. concluded that their modifications to the AMP decreased bimodality compared to a standard AMP (and thus reflected a less intentional measure of evaluations). In Experiment 6 we examined if awareness of influence of the prime is also reduced in the Mann et al. AMP (referred to hereafter as the 'Mann AMP'). We did so by replicating Experiment 3 using this new version of the task. That is, participants were first asked to complete a standard Mann AMP and then complete a version of that task where they could also indicate if they were aware of the prime and its influence on their evaluations (referred to as the 'Mann IA-AMP'). If the Mann AMP successfully limits or excludes influence-aware trials and participants, then we should not expect to replicate our prior findings. However, if we do replicate those findings, then it would suggest that even this purportedly 'improved' version of the task is also heavily dependent on influence awareness. Based on our findings to date, we preregistered two hypotheses. On the one hand, we argued that, at both the group-and trial-level, Mann IA-AMP effects would be strongly moderated by influence awareness. On the other hand, we hypothesized that influence-awareness rates of a given participant in the Mann IA-AMP at Time 2 would predict the size of that same person's Mann AMP effects completed at Time 1. \n",
            " Method \n",
            " Sample selection strategy Power analyses began with an examination of the association between the IA-AMP influence-awareness rates and absolute AMP effects observed in Experiment 2. Results from that study indicated that this association was in the range β = 0.56, 95% CI [0.44, 0.68]. However, we were unsure whether the Mann et al. modification to the AMP would impact the magnitude of this association compared to our previous studies. We therefore opted to power our analyses to detect an even smaller effect size (i.e., β = .20). To power a regression analysis to detect a β = .20 at a 0.05 alpha level (two-tailed) with 95% power requires 320 participants. This was defined as our a priori sample size after exclusions and participants were sampled in a similar fashion to our previous experiments. \n",

            " AMPs The standard Mann AMP consisted of 60 test trials, the same 12 positive and 12 negative valenced prime images as before, as well as 60 abstract paintings, which served as target stimuli. The trial parameters were similar to those reported in our previous studies (i.e., a fixation cross for 500 ms, a valenced prime stimulus for 100 ms, followed by a blank screen for 100 ms, a target painting for 100 ms, after which, a white noise image appeared and replaced that painting). This version of the AMP also provided participants with the following instructions: \"It is crucial that you try to evaluate only the paintings, rather than the pictures that come before them. Even if you are trying to rate only the paintings, you may notice occasionally that your ratings of the paintings are consistent with how you would have rated the previous pictures. That is totally okay. You do not have to worry about whether your ratings of the paintings are consistent, or not, with how you feel about the pictures. Your only job is to evaluate the paintings, and we really need your help in doing this. Do not even worry about the pictures, or how your paintings judgements occasionally match the pictures. Your help to this research is really important. Our data depend on participants like you trying as hard as possible to follow instructions. We really need and appreciate your help.\" The Mann IA-AMP consisted of similar parameters as those used in the standard Mann AMP. The same instructions were provided along with the following: \"Remember: if you do feel like your response to a painting was influenced by the picture that came before it, make sure to press the spacebar when prompted to do so.\" \n",

Results also indicated that influence-awareness rates significantly predicted the magnitude of Mann IA-AMP effects, B = 0.54, 95% CI [0.47, 0.62], β = 0.61, 95% CI [0.53, 0.70], p < .001.

Non-preregistered analyses: Does the predictive utility of influence awareness vary between the standard and Mann AMPs? Following data collection, we noted that effect sizes in the influence rates predicting Mann AMP effects was relatively similar to that reported in Experiment 2. We therefore examined if effect sizes for this analysis in Experiment 2 (where a standard AMP was used) differed significantly from those in Experiment 6 (where a Mann AMP was used). Data from Experiments 2 and 6 were pooled and a similar regression model was constructed as used in those experiments (i.e., Influence Rate as IV,  [Mann]  AMP effect as DV), also adding AMP type (i.e., Experiment) as a fixed effect in the model. If Influence Rate significantly differed in how well it predicted AMP effects between the standard and Mann AMPs, then an interaction between Influence Rate and AMP type (i.e., Experiment) should emerge. However, no such interaction was observed, B = 0.04, 95% CI [-0.09, 0.18], β = 0.05, 95% CI  [-0.11, 0.21] , p = .534. In order to quantify evidence for the absence of this interaction, a Bayes factor for the interaction effect was computed using the BayesFactor R package  (Morey et al., 2015)  by comparing models within and without this interaction effect. This Bayesian analysis using the default prior (Cauchy distribution placed on the effect size with scaling factor r = 0.5) revealed moderate evidence in support of the null hypothesis, BF 10 = 0.12. \n",
            " Discussion The Mann et al. AMP was recently introduced with the aim of eliminating a similar phenomenon as in our previous experiments: namely, that only a subset of participants contribute to the AMP effect. However, we found the same pattern in that version of the task as we did in the standard task: a subset of influence-aware trials (within participants), and highly influence-awareness participants (between participants) strongly moderated AMP effects. Influence-awareness rates in the Mann IA-AMP also predicted effects sizes in a previously completed Mann AMP. Furthermore, the extent to which influence-awareness rates predicted the size of AMP effect sizes did not differ from, and was credibly equivalent to, what was observed in Experiment 2 with the standard AMP. Put simply, we obtained the same pattern of outcomes as reported in Experiments 2-5 with a variant of the AMP specifically designed to eliminate subset effects seen in other AMP research. \n",
            " Experiment 7: Prospective influence-awareness measures also predict AMP effects Experiments 2-6 show that influence awareness is a strong moderator of the magnitude of AMP effects at the individual and group levels, across different versions of the task (standard, Mann et al., IA-AMP), and within the same or between different content domains. Critically, however, we always assessed influence awareness in a retrospective fashion such that people were first asked to emit an evaluative response and only then reflect on it. Although this reflection occurs mere milliseconds after the evaluative response itself, it is still in some sense post hoc. We therefore wanted to know if our findings would replicate when a prospective measure was used, one where awareness is assessed before the evaluative response is emitted. To the best of our knowledge, no such (prospective) measure of awareness has ever been used to examine awareness in the AMP to date. Experiment 7 represents an exact replication of Experiment 3 wherein a standard AMP is completed and then followed by an IA-AMP with primes from the same attitude domain. This IA-AMP was modified into a prospective awareness measure: participants first encountered a prime followed by a target. They were then asked to indicate if they were influence-aware before they provided their evaluative response to the target (instead of after as in Experiments 1-6 and all prior studies in this area). If our findings were to replicate with this new measure, it would lend further evidence to the idea that people are aware of the influence of the prime on evaluative responses, both in retrospective and prospective ways (see Fig.  1 ). \n",

Prospective IA-AMP Prior to this task participants were told: \"The second part of the study will now begin. This part of the study is similar to what you just did. However there is one important difference. This time, before you rate a Chinese character as being pleasant or unpleasant, we will ask you a question: do you think the response you are going to give to the Chinese character will be influenced by the image that first appeared onscreen? If so, and you think that how you are going to respond to the Chinese character will be influenced by the first image then press the spacebar. If not, then simply wait, and when given the opportunity, evaluate the Chinese character as you normally would.\" The IA-AMP consisted of the same parameters as in previous studies (i.e., 12 positively and 12 negatively valenced prime stimuli, 72 Chinese pictographs, ten practice trials, 72 test trials) with one notable change: after the presentation of the target stimulus, but before emitting the evaluative response, participants were given the opportunity to press the spacebar to indicate if they believed their response to the target will be influenced by the prime.

However, it is possible that people may still have formed a covert evaluation of the target after having seen the prime. We therefore had participants register their influence-awareness response before the target stimulus was shown (see Fig.  1 ). In this way, it is highly unlikely that they formed a covert evaluation of the target stimulus given that it had yet to appear. Likewise, it is highly unlikely that their performance on the influence-awareness measure was associated with a covert evaluation of the target stimulus for the very same reason. In such a situation, it seems most plausible that participants are aware of the prime and the impact it is going to have on their evaluations of a target that will be encountered at a later point in time. \n",

This effect was found across seven studies with very little evidence of heterogeneity, suggesting high replicability and generalizability across methodological variations (e.g., when within each IA-AMP trial influence awareness was assessed, and the domain being assessed; see Fig.  3 ). As noted in Experiment 4, this effect holds even when the IA-AMP (used to capture the influence-awareness rate) and the standard AMP are assessing different domains (valence vs. politics). \n",

            " General discussion Over the past 15 years, people have used the AMP under the assumption that its effects represent an implicit measure of attitudes, stereotypes, and other biases. Effects on the task are said to be 'implicit' insofar as prime stimuli influence how target stimuli are evaluated without a person's intention for this to happen, or awareness that such an occurrence has taken place. In this paper, we extend on past work that examined the role of awareness in AMP effects. Across eight preregistered, high-powered studies, including a direct replication and meta-analyses, we re-examined if participants are indeed aware of the prime's influence on their evaluations. In what follows, we summarize our findings and then discuss their implications for research and theorizing on the AMP. \n",
            " Overview of findings Experiment 1 began with an attempt to replicate the finding that standard and 'skip' AMP effects do not differ. The finding that 'skip' AMP effects (i.e., those where 'influenced' responses have been detected and removed) are no different to standard AMP effects is viewed as strong support for the implicit account. We examined if these findings would replicate using an improved and more highly powered design. Results indicated that this finding did not replicate, such that scores on the standard AMP were significantly different from those on the skip AMP. Exploratory analyses also revealed that a given person's awareness of the prime's influence on their evaluations (during the skip AMP at Time 2) was strongly related to the magnitude of their effects in the standard AMP at Time 1. A limitation of the 'skip' AMP is that it forces people to either skip or evaluate the target and thus only provides partial data. To overcome this, we developed an influenceaware IA-AMP in Experiment 2 wherein participants rated the target (thus providing evaluative information) and then indicated if that evaluation had been influenced by the prime (thus providing influence information). Results indicated that AMP effects emerged and that these were moderated at the trial-by-trial level by a subset of (influence-aware) trials, and AMP effects were produced predominantly by highly influence-aware participants at the group level. In Experiments 3-4, we controlled for the possibility that by probing for influence awareness on each trial of the IA-AMP we artificially altered the relationship between awareness and AMP effects. Participants now completed a standard AMP at Time 1 and an IA-AMP at Time 2, either from the same (Experiment 3) or different attitude domains (Experiment 4). Because the standard AMP was always completed prior to the IA-AMP, effects on the former were always unperturbed by modifications to the latter. Yet in both studies influence awareness during an IA-AMP at Time 2 predicted the magnitude of standard AMP effects at Time 1, indicating that influence awareness is a stable (within-participant) pattern of responding that holds within and between content domains. Experiment 5 extended our analyses to three additional questions: is the predictive validity of the AMP effect also dependent on influence awareness; is there intra-individual stability in influence awareness from one AMP to another; and is the relationship between influence awareness and AMP effects bidirectional, such that the presence of one predicts the presence of the other. Two groups of participants (Democrats and Republicans) first completed a political IA-AMP and then an IA-AMP with generic valenced primes. We found that the AMP's ability to correctly classify a person as a Democrat or Republican was superior when effects were based solely on influence-aware trials and inferior when based solely on noninfluence-aware trials. A given person's influence-awareness rate on one AMP was also strongly correlated with their influence awareness on another AMP, even when those tasks target entirely different attitude domains. Finally, the predictive relationship between influence awareness and AMP scores was bidirectional; influence awareness from AMP #1 predicted the AMP effect of AMP #2, and vice versa. Experiment 6 took a newly developed version of the AMP that purportedly reduces subset effects within the AMP (the  Mann et al., 2019 AMP)  and examined if influence awareness also plays a role here, too. Participants first completed a standard Mann AMP and then a Mann IA-AMP. Once again, the same pattern of findings emerged: a subset of influence-aware trials (within participants), and highly influence-awareness participants (between participants) moderated AMP effects. Influence-awareness rates in the Mann IA-AMP also predicted effects sizes in a previously completed Mann AMP. Put simply, the same pattern of outcomes emerged even within a variant of the task designed to optimize the implicitness of the AMP. In our final two studies, we modified the IA-AMP so that influence awareness was measured prospectively, either before the target was evaluated (Experiment 7) or before the target stimulus was even presented (Experiment 8). In this way influence awareness was measured before an overt evaluation took place or a covert evaluation could even be formed. In both studies the same pattern of findings emerged as before. In short, our findings demonstrate that (a) the AMP effect and its predictive validity appear to be moderated by influence aware responding, (b) influence-awareness rates vary widely between individuals but are highly consistent within individuals, within and between attitude domains, (c) participants who are more highly influence aware contribute most to variance in group-level AMP effects, and that (d) recent modifications to the AMP that purportedly control for such subsample effects do not reduce or resolve this issue. Although non-influence-aware trials retain some degree of predictive validity and contribute to some extent to the magnitude of effects, their contributions pale in comparison to that of influence-aware trials. \n",
            " Implications \n",
            " Implicit vs. explicit accounts Our findings consistently show that the majority of variance in group-level AMP effects is explained by those trials wherein participants are aware of how the prime will (prospective measures) or has (retrospective measures) influence(d) their evaluations. This claim holds across eight preregistered studies, different attitude domains, multiple versions of the AMP (standard, Mann et al., IA-AMP), and different influence-awareness measures (prospective and retrospective measures taken on each trial vs. post hoc selfreport questions). Thus it seems reasonable to suggest that AMP effects may not be 'implicit' in the sense of unaware. Rather our findings suggest that people are aware of the prime's influence on how they are responding to the target. foot_5   \n",
            " Theoretical implications Do AMP effects reflect a misattribution process? So far we have focused on the role of awareness in AMP effects. However, our findings are also relevant to another issue, namely the idea that AMP effects are mediated at the mental level by misattribution of prime valence to the target stimulus. Misattribution is traditionally conceived of as occurring in the absence of awareness  (Payne et al., 2005; Schwarz & Clore, 1983) . Indeed, as a reviewer of this paper noted, misattribution by definition cannot occur with awareness. If AMP effects rely heavily on those participants who show awareness of the prime and its influence on their evaluations (as our results indicate), then this suggests two possibilities. On the one hand, AMP effects may reflect misattribution, as is often claimed, yet people are fully aware that misattribution is taking place. Our findings with prospective measures in Experiments 7-8 would also require people to not only be aware of misattribution but be able to predict that it is going to occur even before a target is evaluated or a target stimulus is even presented. Although this idea runs contrary to how misattribution is traditionally defined  (Schwarz & Clore, 1983) , it is possible. For instance, a reviewer of this paper argued that misattributions are -by definition -mistakes. As such, they cannot be entirely understood by the person making the misattribution otherwise they would presumably not make that error. When it comes to the AMP, participants may be aware that their target evaluations are influenced by the primes (especially in cases where they feel strongly about the primes). But they may also hold the belief that the target really does have a particular valence. In other words, just because participants are aware of the priming effect does not necessarily mean that they are aware of how it occurred, and despite this awareness, they may also still genuinely consider the target to be positive or negative. On the other hand, if one contends that misattribution is a mistake made by the individual, and one that occurs without either prospective or retrospective awareness of the prime and its eventual influence on their target responses, then it may be that misattribution is not the best mechanism to explain our AMP effects. This possibility would have implications for those theories and methods that rest on this idea. For instance, it would challenge a misattribution account of AMP effects as well as theoretical perspectives on misattribution that rely on the AMP for support. This includes theoretical models relating to the process of misattribution itself (e.g., the process model of misattribution:  Payne, Hall, Cameron, & Bishara's, 2010) , as well as claims that evaluative conditioning is based on a misattribution process  (Jones et al., 2009) , and that psychological properties beyond evaluations can also be misattributed  (Blaison et al., 2012) . It would also call into question a number of secondgenerational tasks that attempt to exploit the misattribution of meaning (the Semantic Misattribution Procedure:  Sava et al., 2012)  and truth (the Truth Misattribution Procedure:  Cummins & De Houwer, 2019) . It seems likely that the very same issues associated with influence awareness in the standard AMP are likely to play similar roles in these other procedures. Future work could employ a similar IA-AMP style manipulation to these variants to investigate this issue in more detail. Alternative theoretical possibilities During the review process, several reviewers offered alternative theoretical accounts of our findings. One advanced an inferential perspective, according to which participants generate a series of inferences about the stimuli they encounter during the task which then guide how they respond. For instance, when retrospectively asked about awareness in Experiments 1-6 (i.e., before or after they emitted an evaluative response on each trial in Experiments 2-8, or in lieu of an evaluative response in Experiment 1), participants may have inferred that their evaluative response had been influenced by the preceding prime stimulus. This could also have been the case in Experiment 7 (prospective awareness assessed before a response was emitted), if one were to assume that participants knew what their evaluation of the target was going to be when they were given the chance to emit it at the end of the trial. One could even postulate an inferential explanation for Experiment 8 (prospective awareness before the target was even presented), such that participants may have inferred that priming is likely to occur based on the extremity of their reaction to the prime; perhaps because they knew that, in general, they do not have much of an opinion about the target stimulus. This inferential perspective also makes assumptions about some of the more unexpected findings in our paper. Take the fact that standard AMP effects at Time 1 were strongly related to influence-awareness rates in the IA AMP at Time 2. It is possible that participants who showed priming effects in the standard AMP may be more likely to infer that priming sometimes occurs, based on their observation of the congruency between their evaluation of the primes and their evaluation of the targets. Then, in the IA-AMP, when they see primes that elicit strong reactions, they are more likely to predict that priming is about to happen. Such an account shares commonalities with predictive processing theories elsewhere in psychology  (Corlett, Mohanty, & MacDonald, 2020)  as well as inferential accounts in attitude research in particular  (De Houwer, 2018) . It is important to note that if one accepts this account, it necessarily also applies to the original study that is cited as providing evidence that AMP effects are unaware (i.e.,  Payne et al., 2013, Experiment 3) . That is, this account does not argue that AMP effects are in fact unaware, but rather than the evidence to date cannot answer this question. As such, the key implication of this account is congruent with our own account: that this is little evidence supporting the claim that the AMP is unaware. Regardless, it is important to acknowledge that this account cannot easily account for the results of Experiment 8, where participants were asked to report whether the prime stimulus is likely to influence their later evaluation of the target stimulus, given that this rating was provided before the target stimulus was presented or an evaluation of it was given. Another reviewer advanced an attitude strength perspective on our findings. The idea here is that if the AMP is equally valid for all participants, and judgments of influence are caused by attitude strength (i.e., the strength of affective reactions to the primes), then participants with stronger attitudes will consequently report more influence of the primes. When participants are separated based on their influence-awareness ratings, the ones who report little influence will be those with weak attitudes and little variability on AMP scores. Those who report high influence will have strong attitudes and more extreme priming effects. Thus, influence awareness would be a by-product or corollary of attitude strength rather than the main factor driving AMP effects. This account has several potential implications for the role of awareness in the AMP. The first possibility is that this issue also applies to the evidence presented by  Payne et al. (2013, Experiment 3) . For example, perhaps the decision to skip highly influenced trials would also be a corollary of the evaluation. In this case, this would again remove the evidence both for and against the claim that the AMP is unaware, leaving this core claim unsupported. The second possibility is that this issue does not apply to the skip-AMP paradigm employed by  Payne et al. (2013, Experiment 2) , perhaps because this paradigm does not ask participants to report any evaluation they may have if they were influenced by the prime. However, in this case, then this issue also does not apply to our failed replication of Payne et al.'s study in Experiment 1. As such, regardless of the theoretical account one adopts, there is reason to doubt that there is firm evidence that AMP effects are unaware. Regardless of which theoretical account one advocates for, our findings inspire new theoretical perspectives on the AMP effects and highlight the need for more elaborated consideration of the role and nature of awareness within the task. \n",

            " Creating a better implicit measure One option is to modify the AMP effect in ways that exclude influence-aware trials or refine the task itself in some way that diminishes the role of influence awareness on those effects. These changes would allow the AMP to maintain its status as an implicit measure. Our results could be seen as supporting this approach given that (a) even those participants with influence-awareness rates of zero demonstrated (very small) IA-AMP effects, and (b) IA-AMP effects calculated from non-influence-aware trials still possessed some predictive validity for discriminating between known groups. As such, researchers may be tempted to set the standard AMP to the side, employ an IA-AMP, exclude all influence-aware trials, and calculate an effect. This is certainly one way forward. Yet it also comes with its own issues. First, one should not conflate 'non-influence-aware' with 'influence unaware' responding. The IA-AMPs used here asked participants to press the spacebar if their evaluation was influenced by the prime. The presence of such a response provides a measure of influence awareness. Yet the absence of such a response is far more ambiguous. It may be that such trials are free from influence awareness (i.e., are 'influence-unaware'), or they could equally reflect uncertainty about influence, momentary distraction, or other sources of control over responding. Put simply, caution should be exercised when assigning a specific meaning to non-influence-aware trials in the IA-AMP. To better investigate influence-unaware trials, one would need to develop and test a hypothetical 'Influence-Unawareness AMP' (IU-AMP): for example, by asking people to respond when their evaluation was not influenced by the prime. Yet even an IU-AMP would not be without issue. Imagine that an applied researcher in a specific domain wishes to examine differences between two known groups using the IU-AMP and obtains results similar to what we report in Experiment 5 (d = 0.62, using IA-AMP non-influenceaware trials for comparison). To appropriately power her study using the IU-AMP to detect group differences would require at least 138 participants. 13 For the applied researcher, collecting such sample sizes is often either unfeasible or a poor use of limited resources. In contrast, if predictive utility was more important to her than 'process purity', then an IA-AMP capturing influence-aware responses could detect group differences with as few as 16 participants (i.e., IA-AMP effects calculated from influence-aware trials: d = 2.08). Now imagine the flipside. For basic researchers, the need to collect larger sample sizes may be both feasible and desirable if this allows them to study implicit processes in a relatively 'pure' manner. The problem here is that an IU-AMP will likely also lead to a significant number of people being discarded due to zero, or near-zero, levels of unaware task responding. The implication here is that although such an IU-AMP might provide a better implicit measure by implementing changes to the task, the effects obtained from such a task would still not reflect behaviors (or mental processes) in people in general. Yet this is exactly what the AMP is primarily used for. Therefore, just as other fields acknowledge the variety of issues associated with making inferences or generalizations about people in general from non-representative samples (e.g., WEIRD individuals: Henrich, Heine, & Norenzayan, 2010; neuroscience tending to only study the brains of right-handed people: Willems, der Haegen, Fisher, & Francks, 2014; animal models of pathology that are based on male biology but not female: Mogil, 2016), we need to do the same. Both applied and basic researchers using the AMP (or AMP-like tasks, including the IU-AMP) need to carefully attend to the dangers of making inferences and generalizations about people in general from an effect that reflects a special subset of people. \n",
            " Exploring the (interactive) role of automaticity conditions within the AMP Our work focused on one particular automaticity condition (awareness), and one particular sub-type of awareness (influence awareness). It would be interesting to explore if other types of awareness also impact AMP effects in the way that influence awareness does. For instance, are AMP effects are moderated by a participant's awareness of the content under investigation (i.e., that they have an automatic evaluative preference for one group over another). Or their awareness of how their automatic content is being assessed by the task (e.g., via speeded categorization of one social group with positive words and a second group with negative words as in the IAT). Or the presence of particular stimuli and response requirements in the procedure (e.g., that a black person is being presented as a prime stimulus). Or their awareness of the origin of their AMP effects (e.g., stemming from society or their personal learning history) . 14  Similarly, it would be interesting to explore if and how awareness interacts with other automaticity conditions, and how their interaction contributes to the AMP effect. Take, for instance, intention. Is it that awareness of the prime's influence on target evaluations is a precondition for intentional responding (i.e., one can only intend to respond to the target in-line with the prime once they are aware of both stimuli and the latter's relationship to the former)? Is it a pre-condition for controlling how one responds (demand) or for combatting the unwanted influence of certain stimuli over automatic behavior (e.g., if one wants to exert control over their automatic responses do they first need to be aware of the relationship between stimuli in the environment and how they influence those responses)? Is it possible to be influence-aware and still respond in an unintentional manner? Future work could explore these and related issues. \n",
            " Revision of existing findings Research on the AMP is typically founded on two assumptions: (a) that AMP effects are reflective of implicit attitudes, and (b) that AMP effects represent an equally valid measure of such attitudes across all individuals (e.g.,  Fox et al., 2018; Kalmoe & Piston, 2013; Mann et al., 2019; Payne et al., 2005; Rinck & Becker, 2007; Spring & Bulik, 2014) . To illustrate, consider a study by  Franklin et al. (2014) , which concluded that \"young adults with a history of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) display a significantly stronger implicit identification with [images of skin] cutting\" compared to 13 Using G*Power  (Faul, Erdfelder, Buchner, & Lang, 2009) : Independent t test, alpha = 0.05 (two-sided), power = 0.95. 14 The different ways that awareness can be potentially defined and studied makes it difficult to (a) arrive at general conclusions about the role of awareness from past work, and (b) requires precision about what type of awareness one is measuring, and how they have done so (for a more detailed treatment of this issue see  Hahn & Goedderz, 2020; Corneille & Hütter, 2020) . It is for this reason that we continually made reference to influence awareness throughout this paper, and sought to measure it using a range of measures (e.g., trial-by-trial vs. post hoc self-reports), attitude domains, and both prospectively and retrospectively. 1 their counterparts without such a history of NSSI. Our findings suggest that such a result should instead be interpreted as \"in those young adults who are highly influence aware on the AMP, those with a history of NSSI also self-identify more with NSSI compared to those who had no such history. However, little can be said about those with low influenceawareness rates.\" This is just one example; similar revisions need to be applied to the core claims of research using the AMP (e.g., via systematic review), which may alter the conclusions derived from that body of work. \n",
            " What form does influence awareness take in a standard AMP? Our findings highlight a deep connection between performance on the IA-AMP and standard AMP. The fact that performance on the IA-AMP predicts the magnitude of standard AMPs that either come before or after it, both within and between different attitude domains, and when influence awareness is measured in different prospective and retrospective manners indicates that what holds in the former likely plays out in the latter. But this raises the question -how does influence awareness play out in standard AMPs? Is it that participants pause after each and every prime-target presentation, reflect on what they just saw, and then use this information to inform every individual target evaluation that they make? This seems unlikely to us given that trial latencies (while not critical to the effect or the task) are typically short. One alternative is that people don't stop and reflect on every standard AMP trial but do stop and reflect on multiple trials, and this awareness of the prime's influence grows as one completes the task. Yet another alternative is that stopping and reflecting on a single trial early on in the task may lead people to generate inferences that influence how they subsequently perform (e.g., \"Certain primes keep influencing how I respond…\" or \"Certain stimuli [primes] keep flashing up on screen…maybe I'm supposed to respond to them in a particular way…\"). In other words, as one Reviewer suggested, responding to the targets than follow primes may make people self-conscious about their performance, and attune them to possible explanations for that performance, that subsequently influence it. In short, future research could examine how influence awareness actually plays out within the standard AMP. This would not only provide useful information about the task itself, but also about influence awareness as a process. \n",
            " What makes a person influence-aware? Our results also raise the question of what characterizes and differentiates highly influence-aware participants who moderate AMP effects from the rest of the population. Experiment 6, which employed the modifications to the AMP suggested by  Mann et al. (2019) , suggests that both influence-awareness rate and moderation of the magnitude of AMP effects by influence awareness is not reduced through simple alterations to the task itself. Experiment 5 suggests that an individual's influence-awareness rate is consistent across IA-AMPs assessing different domains, and that the influence-awareness rate demonstrated in one domain predicts AMP effects in another. As such, it seems that influence-awareness rates are an individual difference variable rather than merely random noise or properties of the task itself. While beyond the scope of the current research, future work could examine whether influence awareness is a stateor trait-like property (e.g., whether it is consistent across time and context), whether it is related to other individual differences (e.g., Need for Cognition:  Cacioppo & Petty, 1982) , or indeed whether influence awareness on the AMP is related to performance on other kinds of implicit measures (e.g., the Implicit Association Test). 15 \n",
            " Diversity and Inclusiveness Experiments 1-8 were carried out online on a platform that recruits participants from the general population (Prolific Academic). An analysis of the demographic data we requested in our studies (age, gender, and political orientation [in Experiments 4 and 5]) revealed that our samples were broadly representative in terms of age (ranging from 18 to 65 years), and balanced in terms of gender (847 women, 741 men, 15 other). As such, in our efforts to reexamine different properties of the AMP effect, we recruited samples that were, at worst, no less representative as the original AMP studies that we build and extend upon. At best, our samples are likely more representative than the original studies given that we did not recruit solely from undergraduate students (i.e., more balanced in terms of age and levels of education). That said, we did not request information on other demographic variables (e.g., sexuality, ethnicity). Although we had no theoretical reason to assume that such variables would moderate performance on a generic valence AMP, it is perhaps plausible they are associated 15 One could also explore other factors that may impact how much one is likely to be influence aware during an AMP, from one's previous experience with the task (e.g., extensive vs. limited prior AMP exposure), as well as their motivation or opportunity to process information during the task in an effortful manner. Likewise, one could examine what properties of the AMP alter one's likelihood of being influence aware. Is it that certain types of primes that are more likely to elicit influence awareness than others (e.g., because of their valence, extremity, familiarity). Is it that certain types of instructions direct attention towards vs. away from the prime, or the relationship between the prime and target, and this also alters influence awareness? Both topics seems worthy of future investigation. 1 with performance on the political IA-AMPs in particular. Likewise, given that Experiments 4-5 were sampled exclusively from US residents, and that the majority of Prolific Academic participants reside in the UK, our samples are primarily made up of (and potentially over-represent) individuals from these nations. Future work may therefore wish to capture more detailed demographics information or could replicate our findings across different nationalities to further expand its remit. \n",
            " Conclusions AMP effects do not appear to be implicit in at least one sense (i.e., unaware). Our results show that both the magnitude of AMP effects and their predictive validity are strongly moderated by awareness. As such, insofar as (1) the AMP has been claimed to be implicit in the sense of being (influence) unaware and (2) utility can be defined in terms of large AMP effects and/or AMP effects that possess predictive validity (i.e., the criteria employed in this previous literature to date; e.g.,  Payne et al., 2013) , what is useful about the effect is not particularly implicit, and what is implicit about the effect is not particularly useful. This finding raises a host of conceptual, theoretical, and applied questions for past and future research using the task as well as its ability to make inferences about psychological phenomena in people in general (i.e., rather than merely in a subset of highly aware participants).\n"

Of the 47 articles from the eligible pool that were not claimed, six (13%) had been deemed infeasible to replicate because of time, resources, instrumentation, dependence on historical events, or hard-to-access samples. The remaining 41 (87%) were eligible but not claimed. These often required specialized samples (such as macaques or people with autism), resources (such as eye tracking machines or functional magnetic resonance imaging), or knowledge making them difficult to match with teams. Aggregate data preparation Each replication team conducted the study, analyzed their data, wrote their summary report, and completed a checklist of requirements for sharing the materials and data. Then, independent reviewers and analysts conducted a projectwide audit of all individual projects, materials, data, and reports. A description of this review is available on the OSF ( https://osf.io/xtine ). Moreover, to maximize reproducibility and accuracy, the analyses for every replication study were reproduced by another analyst independent of the replication team using the R statistical programming language and a standardized analytic format. A controller R script was created to regenerate the entire analysis of every study and recreate the master data file. This R script, available at  https://osf.io/fkmwg , can be executed to reproduce the results of the individual studies. A comprehensive description of this reanalysis process is available publicly ( https://osf.io/a2eyg ). Measures and moderators We assessed features of the original study and replication as possible correlates of reproducibility and conducted exploratory analyses to inspire further investigation. These included characteristics of the original study such as the publishing journal; original effect size, P value, and sample size; experience and expertise of the original research team; importance of the effect, with indicators such as the citation impact of the article; and rated surprisingness of the effect. We also assessed characteristics of the replication such as statistical power and sample size, experience and expertise of the replication team, independently assessed challenge of conducting an effective replication, and self-assessed quality of the replication effort. Variables such as the P value indicate the statistical strength of evidence given the null hypothesis, and variables such as \\\"effect surprisingness\\\" and \\\"expertise of the team\\\" indicate qualities of the topic of study and the teams studying it, respectively.\",\n          \"When there is no effect to detect, the null distribution of P values is uniform. This distribution deviated slightly from uniform with positive skew, however, suggesting that at least one replication could be a false negative, c 2 (128) = 155.83, P = 0.048. Nonetheless, the wide distribution of P values suggests against insufficient power as the only explanation for failures to replicate. A scatterplot of original compared with replication study P values is shown in Fig. 2 . Evaluating replication effect against original effect size A complementary method for evaluating replication is to test whether the original effect size is within the 95% CI of the effect size estimate from the replication. For the subset of 73 studies in which the standard error of the correlation could be computed, 30 (41.1%) of the replication CIs contained the original effect size (significantly lower than the expected value of 78.5%, P < 0.001) (supplementary materials). For 22 studies using other test statistics [F(df 1 > 1, df 2 ) and c 2 ], 68.2% of CIs contained the effect size of the original study. Overall, this analysis suggests a 47.4% replication success rate. This method addresses the weakness of the first test that a replication in the same direction and a P value of 0.06 may not be significantly different from the original result. However, the method will also indicate that a replication \\\"fails\\\" when the direction of the effect is the same but the replication effect size is significantly smaller than the original effect size  (29) . Also, the replication \\\"succeeds\\\" when the result is near zero but not estimated with sufficiently high precision to be distinguished from the original effect size. Comparing original and replication effect sizes Comparing the magnitude of the original and replication effect sizes avoids special emphasis on P values. Overall, original study effect sizes (M = 0.403, SD = 0.188) were reliably larger than replication effect sizes (M = 0.197, SD = 0.257), Wilcoxon's W = 7137, P < 0.001.\",\n          \"Title: Estimating the reproducibility of psychological science Open Science Collaboration*\\n\\nAbstract: \\n INTRODUCTION: Reproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown. Scientific claims should not gain credence because of the status or authority of their originator but by the replicability of their supporting evidence. Even research of exemplary quality may have irreproducible empirical findings because of random or systematic error. RATIONALE: There is concern about the rate and predictors of reproducibility, but limited evidence. Potentially problematic practices include selective reporting, selective analysis, and insufficient specification of the conditions necessary or sufficient to obtain the results. Direct replication is the attempt to recreate the conditions believed sufficient for obtaining a pre-RESEARCH \\n\\n\\nBody:\\n\\n viously observed finding and is the means of establishing reproducibility of a finding with new data. We conducted a large-scale, collaborative effort to obtain an initial estimate of the reproducibility of psychological science. RESULTS  :  We conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using highpowered designs and original materials when available. There is no single standard for evaluating replication success. Here, we evaluated reproducibility using significance and P values, effect sizes, subjective assessments of replication teams, and meta-analysis of effect sizes. The mean effect size (r) of the replication effects (M r = 0.197, SD = 0.257) was half the magnitude of the mean effect size of the original effects (M r = 0.403, SD = 0.188), representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had significant results (P < .05). Thirty-six percent of replications had significant results; 47% of original effect sizes were in the 95% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams. CONCLUSION: No single indicator sufficiently describes replication success, and the five indicators examined here are not the only ways to evaluate reproducibility.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"embedding\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Of the 47 articles from the eligible pool that were not claimed, six (13%) had been deemed infeasible to replicate because of time, resources, instrumentation, dependence on historical events, or hard-to-access samples. The remaining 41 (87%) were eligible but not claimed. These often required specialized samples (such as macaques or people with autism), resources (such as eye tracking machines or functional magnetic resonance imaging), or knowledge making them difficult to match with teams. Aggregate data preparation Each replication team conducted the study, analyzed their data, wrote their summary report, and completed a checklist of requirements for sharing the materials and data. Then, independent reviewers and analysts conducted a projectwide audit of all individual projects, materials, data, and reports. A description of this review is available on the OSF ( https://osf.io/xtine ). Moreover, to maximize reproducibility and accuracy, the analyses for every replication study were reproduced by another analyst independent of the replication team using the R statistical programming language and a standardized analytic format. A controller R script was created to regenerate the entire analysis of every study and recreate the master data file. This R script, available at  https://osf.io/fkmwg , can be executed to reproduce the results of the individual studies. A comprehensive description of this reanalysis process is available publicly ( https://osf.io/a2eyg ). Measures and moderators We assessed features of the original study and replication as possible correlates of reproducibility and conducted exploratory analyses to inspire further investigation. These included characteristics of the original study such as the publishing journal; original effect size, P value, and sample size; experience and expertise of the original research team; importance of the effect, with indicators such as the citation impact of the article; and rated surprisingness of the effect. We also assessed characteristics of the replication such as statistical power and sample size, experience and expertise of the replication team, independently assessed challenge of conducting an effective replication, and self-assessed quality of the replication effort. Variables such as the P value indicate the statistical strength of evidence given the null hypothesis, and variables such as \\\"effect surprisingness\\\" and \\\"expertise of the team\\\" indicate qualities of the topic of study and the teams studying it, respectively.\",\n          \"Exclusions (explanation provided in supplementary materials, A3) are \\\"replications P < .05\\\" (3 original nulls excluded; n = 97 studies), \\\"effect size difference\\\" (3 excluded; n = 97 studies); \\\"meta-analytic mean estimates\\\" (27 excluded; n = 73 studies); and, \\\"percent original effect size within replication 95% CI\\\" (5 excluded, n = 95 studies). 1 .

The test assumes the same population effect size for original and replication study in the same study-pair.

This offers an even harder form of output control compared to the logit_bias approach. While logit_bias can nudge the model toward certain tokens, it does not guarantee valid output and may occasionally result in refusals. In contrast, the function-calling approach guarantees a structured response that conforms to the schema, provided the model chooses to call the function.
